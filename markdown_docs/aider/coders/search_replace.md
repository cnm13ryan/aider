## ClassDef RelativeIndenter
**RelativeIndenter**: The function of RelativeIndenter is to reformat text files by rewriting lines to have relative indentation, making it easier to search and apply edits to pairs of code blocks that may differ significantly in their overall level of indentation.
**attributes**: 
· texts: A list of strings representing the input texts to be reformatted.

**Code Description**: The RelativeIndenter class is designed to handle the process of transforming text with relative indentation. It first determines a unique marker character (such as "←") that will not conflict with any existing characters in the input text. This marker is used to indicate outdenting when necessary. The core functionality lies in two main methods: `make_relative` and `make_absolute`.

- **__init__(self, texts)**: Initializes the RelativeIndenter object by selecting a unique marker character that isn't present in any of the provided texts. It iterates through each text to identify common characters and then selects a suitable outdent marker.

- **select_unique_marker(self, chars)**: This method searches for a Unicode character that is not already used within the given set of characters (chars). It starts from higher codepoints and works its way down until it finds an unused character. If no such character can be found, it raises a ValueError indicating that no unique marker could be determined.

- **make_relative(self, text)**: Transforms a single string of text to use relative indentation. The method checks if the text already contains the outdent marker and raises an error if so. It processes each line, calculating the difference in indentation compared to the previous line. If lines are less indented than the preceding one, it uses the selected marker character to indicate this change.

- **make_absolute(self, text)**: Reverses the transformation performed by `make_relative`, converting relative indentation back to absolute indentation. It handles outdent markers and ensures that no marker characters remain in the final output.

The RelativeIndenter class is called by the `relative_indent` function, which takes a list of texts as input. This function creates an instance of RelativeIndenter and then applies the `make_relative` method to each text in the list, returning both the instance of RelativeIndenter and the reformatted texts.

**Note**: Ensure that the input texts do not already contain the selected outdent marker before calling the `relative_indent` function. The output will be a list of strings with relative indentation applied.

**Output Example**: Given an input text like:
```
            Foo
                Bar
                Baz
            Fob # indented 4 less than the preceding line
```

The `make_relative` method would transform it to something like:
```
            Foo
            <marker>Bar
            <marker>Baz
            <marker>Fob
```

Where `<marker>` represents the unique outdent marker character.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, texts)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of `RelativeIndenter` by selecting a unique Unicode character that is not present in any provided text.

**Parameters**:
· parameter1: `texts`: A list or iterable containing the texts from which we need to select a unique marker.

**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` method starts by creating an empty set called `chars` to store all characters found across the provided texts. It then iterates over each text in the `texts` parameter and updates the `chars` set with the characters from that text using the `update` method of sets.

After collecting all unique characters, it checks if the predefined Unicode arrow character "←" is not present in the `chars` set. If this character is available and does not conflict with any existing characters, it assigns this character to the instance variable `marker`. Otherwise, it calls the `select_unique_marker` method to find a suitable marker that is unique among all provided characters.

This approach ensures that the selected marker is distinct from any character used in the given texts, which is crucial for tasks such as search and replace operations where a unique marker can be introduced without clashing with existing content. The use of `select_unique_marker` guarantees that even if common or special Unicode characters are already present in the texts, a suitable marker will still be found.

**Note**: When using this method, ensure that the input `texts` contains all relevant characters to avoid conflicts, as the process of finding a unique character can be computationally expensive. Also, consider the performance implications when dealing with large or complex sets of texts.
***
### FunctionDef select_unique_marker(self, chars)
**select_unique_marker**: The function of `select_unique_marker` is to find a unique Unicode character that is not present in a given set of characters.
**Parameters**:
· parameter1: `chars`: A set of characters from which we need to find a unique marker.

**Code Description**: 
The `select_unique_marker` method iterates through a range of Unicode code points, starting from the highest possible value (0x10FFFF) and decrementing by 1 until it reaches 0x10000. For each code point, it converts the code point to its corresponding character using `chr(codepoint)` and checks if this character is not present in the given set of characters (`chars`). If such a character is found, it returns that character as the unique marker.

This method ensures that we can find a suitable Unicode character for use as a marker, even when simpler characters like ASCII or common Unicode characters might already be used within the texts being processed. This function is particularly useful in scenarios where we need to introduce a new element (such as an indicator or delimiter) without conflicting with existing content.

The `select_unique_marker` method is called by another method in the same class, `_init_`, which initializes an instance of `RelativeIndenter`. In this context, if no suitable marker can be found from predefined options like "←", then it uses `select_unique_marker` to find a unique character. This ensures that any new marker chosen does not clash with existing characters in the texts being processed.

**Note**: When calling `select_unique_marker`, ensure that the set of characters provided is comprehensive enough to cover all potential conflicts, as iterating through Unicode code points can be computationally expensive and time-consuming if the set of characters is large or complex.

**Output Example**: The output could be any unique character from the high Unicode range (e.g., a rarely used symbol like U+1D17E GREEK SMALL LETTER PI WITH HOOK). For instance, `select_unique_marker({"a", "b", "c"})` might return a character like `'\U0001d17e'`.
***
### FunctionDef make_relative(self, text)
**make_relative**: The function of make_relative is to transform text by converting absolute indents into relative ones.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: `text` (The input string that needs to be transformed)
**Code Description**: 
The `make_relative` method processes the given text, transforming it so that each line's indentation is represented relatively rather than absolutely. This transformation uses a marker defined in the class instance (`self.marker`) to denote outdenting.

1. **Check for Marker Presence**: The function first checks if the marker specified by `self.marker` already exists in the input text. If found, it raises a `ValueError` with an appropriate message.
2. **Split Text into Lines**: The input text is split into lines using `splitlines(keepends=True)`, preserving newline characters at the end of each line.
3. **Initialize Variables**: A list `output` to store processed lines and a variable `prev_indent` to keep track of the previous line's indentation are initialized.
4. **Process Each Line**:
   - For every line, strip off any trailing newline character with `rstrip("\n\r")`.
   - Determine the length of the current line’s leading whitespace using `len(line_without_end) - len(line_without_end.lstrip())` and store it in `len_indent`.
   - Extract the actual indentation part from the line into a variable called `indent`.
   - Calculate the change in indentation relative to the previous line (`change = len_indent - len(prev_indent)`).
   - Based on this change, adjust the current line’s indentation:
     - If the change is positive, use the last `change` characters of the extracted `indent`.
     - If negative, prepend a sequence of markers defined by `self.marker` to represent outdenting.
     - If no change, leave the current line's indentation as an empty string.
   - Append the processed line (with updated indentation) to the `output` list and update `prev_indent` with the current line’s indentation.

5. **Construct Result**: Join all lines in the `output` list into a single string and return it.

**Note**: Ensure that the input text does not already contain the marker used for outdenting, as this could lead to incorrect transformations.

**Output Example**: If the input is:
```
    def example():
        print("This is an example.")
```
And the class instance has a marker of `'>'`, the output might be:
```
>def example():
>>print("This is an example.")
```
***
### FunctionDef make_absolute(self, text)
**make_absolute**: The function of `make_absolute` is to transform text from relative back to absolute indents.
**parameters**:
· text: The input string that needs to be transformed from relative indents to absolute indents.

**Code Description**:
The `make_absolute` method takes the input `text`, which has been processed with relative indentation, and converts it back to absolute indentation. Here's a detailed analysis of how this function works:

1. **Splitting Input into Lines**: The first step is to split the input text into lines using `splitlines(keepends=True)`. This ensures that line breaks are preserved in the output.

2. **Initialization**: Two variables, `output` and `prev_indent`, are initialized. `output` will store the final transformed text, and `prev_indent` keeps track of the previous indent level to handle outdenting correctly.

3. **Iterating Over Lines**: The function iterates over every second line in the input text (i.e., lines at even indices). For each pair of lines:
   - The first line (`dent`) is stripped of trailing whitespace.
   - The second line (`non_indent`) remains unchanged.
   
4. **Determining Indentation**:
   - If `dent` starts with a specific marker, it indicates an outdent. The length of the indent in `dent` is calculated and used to determine the new `cur_indent`.
   - Otherwise, the current indentation level (`cur_indent`) is updated by concatenating `prev_indent` and `dent`.

5. **Handling Blank Lines**: If the second line (`non_indent`) is blank after stripping whitespace, it is not indented; otherwise, it is indented according to the new `cur_indent`.

6. **Building Output**: The transformed lines are appended to the `output` list.

7. **Updating Previous Indentation**: After processing each pair of lines, `prev_indent` is updated to `cur_indent`.

8. **Error Handling and Finalization**: If any line in the output still contains the marker after transformation, a `ValueError` is raised. Otherwise, the transformed text is joined back into a single string and returned.

9. The function interacts with the calling context by being called within the `try_strategy` method to handle specific preprocessing steps during text processing.

**Note**: Ensure that the input text does not contain any markers after transformation; otherwise, an error will be raised.

**Output Example**: Given the input:
```
    marker
    line1

    marker
    line2
```
The output would be:
```
line1

line2
```

# Documentation for `calculateTotalSales`

## Overview

The `calculateTotalSales` function is designed to compute the total sales amount based on a given list of individual sales transactions.

## Function Signature

```python
def calculateTotalSales(sales: List[Dict[str, Union[int, float]]]) -> float:
    pass
```

## Parameters

- **sales** (List[Dict[str, Union[int, float]]]): A list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a sales transaction. Each dictionary contains the following keys:
  - `transaction_id`: An integer representing the unique identifier for the transaction.
  - `amount`: A floating-point number representing the amount of the sale.

## Return Value

- **float**: The total sum of all sales amounts in the provided list.

## Example Usage

```python
sales_data = [
    {"transaction_id": 1, "amount": 25.50},
    {"transaction_id": 2, "amount": 37.99},
    {"transaction_id": 3, "amount": 45.25}
]

total_sales = calculateTotalSales(sales_data)
print(total_sales)  # Output: 108.74
```

## Detailed Explanation

The `calculateTotalSales` function iterates through the list of sales transactions and sums up the amounts associated with each transaction.

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes a variable to hold the total sum, starting at zero.
2. **Iteration**: It then iterates over each dictionary in the `sales` list.
3. **Summation**: For each dictionary, it retrieves the value associated with the key `"amount"` and adds this amount to the total sum.
4. **Return Value**: After processing all transactions, the function returns the accumulated total sum as a floating-point number.

## Error Handling

- If the `sales` parameter is not provided or is an empty list, the function will return 0.0.
- The function assumes that each dictionary in the `sales` list contains the keys `"transaction_id"` and `"amount"`. Any deviation from this structure will result in a runtime error.

## Performance Considerations

The time complexity of the `calculateTotalSales` function is O(n), where n is the number of sales transactions. This makes it efficient for processing even large datasets.

## Notes

- The function does not perform any validation on the input data to ensure that all dictionaries contain valid transaction IDs and amounts.
- For more complex scenarios, such as handling different currencies or additional transaction details, consider extending the `sales` dictionary structure accordingly.

By following this documentation, users can effectively utilize the `calculateTotalSales` function in their applications.
## FunctionDef line_pad(text)
**line_pad**: The function of line_pad is to add padding lines before and after the input text.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: text (str) - The input text that needs to be padded with lines.

**Code Description**: 
The `line_pad` function takes a single string argument, `text`, which represents the content to be surrounded by additional newline characters. Inside the function, it first calculates the padding needed by multiplying the newline character (`\n`) by the value of `line_padding`. This calculated padding is then concatenated with the original `text`, effectively adding lines before and after the text.

Here's a detailed breakdown:
1. **Padding Calculation**: The variable `padding` is assigned the value of `\n` repeated `line_padding` times. This creates a string consisting entirely of newline characters, which will be used as padding.
2. **Text Concatenation**: The original `text` is then concatenated with this `padding`, resulting in a new string that has lines before and after the text.

This function can be useful for formatting output where additional spacing around content is desired, such as when displaying messages or sections within a larger interface.

**Note**: Ensure that `line_padding` is defined and assigned an appropriate integer value before calling this function. If `line_padding` is not set, the function will default to zero padding, meaning no extra lines will be added.

**Output Example**: 
If `text = "Hello, world!"` and `line_padding = 2`, then the output would be:
```

    
Hello, world!
    
```
## FunctionDef line_unpad(text)
**line_unpad**: The function of line_unpad is to remove padding characters from both ends of a given string if they are newline characters.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: text (The input string that potentially has leading and trailing newline characters.)

**Code Description**: 
This function aims to clean up the input text by removing any leading or trailing newline characters. Here's how it works:

- The function first checks whether the first `line_padding` characters and the last `line_padding` characters of the input `text` are all newline characters (`\n`). This is done using a set comparison, where both substrings are converted into sets to check for equality.
- If the condition is not met (i.e., if there are non-newline characters at either end), the function returns without making any changes to the original text.
- If the condition is met, it then returns a new string that excludes these leading and trailing newline characters by slicing the input `text` from `line_padding` to `-line_padding`.

**Note**: 
1. The variable `line_padding` must be defined in the surrounding scope or passed as an argument for this function to work correctly.
2. Ensure that the `line_padding` value is appropriate for your use case, as it determines how many characters at each end are considered for padding.

**Output Example**: 
If the input string is:
```
\n\nHello, World!\n\n
```
And assuming `line_padding = 3`, the function will return:
```
Hello, World!
```

## FunctionDef lines_to_chars(lines, mapping)
**lines_to_chars**: The function of `lines_to_chars` is to convert lines into characters based on a given mapping.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: `lines`, a list of strings representing text lines.
· parameter2: `mapping`, a dictionary that maps ASCII values of characters to their corresponding new characters.

**Code Description**: 
The function `lines_to_chars` takes two parameters: `lines` and `mapping`. The purpose is to transform each character in the input `lines` according to the mappings provided by `mapping`. Here's how it works:

1. An empty list `new_text` is initialized to store the transformed characters.
2. Each character from the `lines` is iterated over using a for loop.
3. For every character, its ASCII value is obtained using `ord()`, and this value is used as a key in the `mapping` dictionary to fetch the corresponding new character.
4. The fetched character is appended to the `new_text` list.
5. After all characters have been processed, the `new_text` list is joined into a single string using `"".join(new_text)`.
6. Finally, the transformed text is returned.

This function plays a crucial role in the caller `dmp_lines_apply`, where it helps to apply transformations based on character mappings after performing line-based operations and generating patches for changes between different texts.

**Note**: Ensure that the input `lines` contains only characters that are present in the keys of the `mapping` dictionary. Any missing key will result in an error or unexpected behavior.

**Output Example**: If `lines = ['a', 'b']` and `mapping = {97: 100, 98: 99}` (where ASCII value 97 is 'a' and 98 is 'b'), the output will be `'d'` because 'a' maps to 'd' and 'b' maps to 'c'.

## FunctionDef diff_lines(search_text, replace_text)
**diff_lines**: The function of `diff_lines` is to compute the differences between two blocks of text by converting lines into characters, performing a main difference calculation, and then cleaning up the result.
**parameters**:
· search_text: A string representing the original block of text that needs to be compared against another block.
· replace_text: A string representing the target block of text that is being compared with the first block.

**Code Description**: 
The `diff_lines` function utilizes the `diff_match_patch` library to compute differences between two blocks of text, `search_text` and `replace_text`. The process involves several steps:
1. **Character Conversion**: Lines in both texts are converted into characters using `dmp.diff_linesToChars`, which helps in identifying more granular differences.
2. **Difference Calculation**: Using the converted lines, the function computes the main differences with `diff_main` and applies cleanup functions to improve efficiency and readability of the result.
3. **Line Conversion Back**: The cleaned-up diff information is then converted back into line format using `dmp.diff_charsToLines`.
4. **Character-Level Differences**: For each difference, the function checks if it's an addition (`+`) or deletion (`-`), and formats them accordingly.
5. **Return Value**: Finally, the function returns a list of strings where each string represents a character-level difference with appropriate signs.

The relationship between `diff_lines` and its callers in the project is as follows:
- The `make_new_lines_explicit` function from `aider/coders/udiff_coder.py` calls `diff_lines` to compute differences between two blocks of text. This helps in generating explicit, character-level changes that can be used for further processing or display purposes.

**Note**: Ensure that the `diff_match_patch` library is correctly installed and imported before using this function. The cleanup functions (`diff_cleanupSemantic` and `diff_cleanupEfficiency`) are crucial for optimizing the diff results; however, in some cases, they might be commented out depending on specific requirements.

**Output Example**: 
Given `search_text = "This is a test."` and `replace_text = "This is another test."`, the output could look like:
```
[' ', 'T', 'h', 'i', 's', ' ', 'i', 's', ' ', '+a', '+n', '+o', '+t', '+h', '+e', 'r', ' ', 't', 'e', 's', 't', '.']
```
## FunctionDef search_and_replace(texts)
**search_and_replace**: The function of `search_and_replace` is to replace occurrences of a search text within an original text using a specified replacement text.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: texts (tuple) - A tuple containing three elements: the search text, the replace text, and the original text.

**Code Description**:
The `search_and_replace` function processes a given input which is expected to be a tuple of three strings. It counts the number of occurrences of the search text within the original text using the `count()` method. If there are no occurrences (i.e., the count is zero), the function returns without performing any replacements and exits early. Otherwise, it proceeds to replace all instances of the search text with the specified replacement text using the `replace()` method on the original text.

The function then returns the modified text or `None` if no replacements were made. This behavior ensures that only texts containing at least one instance of the search text are processed and returned.

From a functional perspective, this function is called within another function named `flexi_just_search_and_replace`. The purpose of `flexi_just_search_and_replace` appears to be to apply multiple search-and-replace strategies (one being `search_and_replace`) to a given set of texts. By calling `search_and_replace`, it ensures that the original text is modified according to specific criteria, and only relevant replacements are performed.

**Note**: Ensure that the input tuple contains exactly three elements: the search text, replace text, and original text. If no occurrences of the search text are found in the original text, the function will return `None`.

**Output Example**: 
If the input is `('hello', 'hi', 'hello world')`, the output would be `'hi world'`. However, if the input is `('bye', 'hi', 'hello world')`, the function will return `None` as there are no occurrences of 'bye' in the original text.
## FunctionDef git_cherry_pick_osr_onto_o(texts)
**git_cherry_pick_osr_onto_o**: The function of `git_cherry_pick_osr_onto_o` is to simulate a Git cherry-pick operation from "Replace" (R) onto "Original" (O), while handling potential merge conflicts.
**Parameters**:
· parameter1: `texts` - A tuple containing three strings: the original text (`original_text`), the search text (`search_text`), and the replace text (`replace_text`).

**Code Description**: 
The function begins by unpacking the input `texts` into three variables: `original_text`, `search_text`, and `replace_text`. It then creates a temporary Git repository within a directory using `GitTemporaryDirectory`.

1. **Original State (O)**: A file named "file.txt" is created with the content of `original_text`. The changes are committed to the repository, creating an initial commit.
2. **Search State (S)**: The content of "file.txt" is updated to `search_text`, and another commit is made.
3. **Replace State (R)**: The file's content is changed to `replace_text` again, followed by a third commit.

After setting up these three states, the function returns to the original state (O) using `repo.git.checkout(original_hash)`.

4. **Cherry-Pick Operation**: An attempt is made to cherry-pick the "Replace" commit (`replace_hash`) onto the current branch. If there are merge conflicts during this operation, it will catch these exceptions and handle them appropriately.
5. **Return Value**: The function does not return any value explicitly but performs operations that can be observed in the temporary Git repository.

**Note**: This function is useful for testing how cherry-picking works with different states of a file and handling potential conflicts during the process.

**Output Example**: 
- If no merge conflicts occur, the temporary Git repository will reflect the state after successfully cherry-picking "Replace" onto "Original".
- In case of merge conflicts, the function might raise an exception or handle it internally depending on how exceptions are managed in the project.
## FunctionDef git_cherry_pick_sr_onto_so(texts)
**git_cherry_pick_sr_onto_so**: The function of `git_cherry_pick_sr_onto_so` is to perform a Git cherry-pick operation from one text state onto another.

**Parameters**:
· parameter1: `texts`, which is expected to be a tuple containing three strings: `search_text`, `replace_text`, and `original_text`.

**Code Description**: 
The function `git_cherry_pick_sr_onto_so` performs a series of Git operations using a temporary directory. Here’s the detailed analysis:

1. **Initialization and Setup**:
   - The input `texts` is unpacked into three variables: `search_text`, `replace_text`, and `original_text`.
   - A temporary Git repository is created within a new directory, which acts as a sandbox for these operations.

2. **Creating the Initial Search State**:
   - A text file named "file.txt" is written with content from `search_text` in this temporary directory.
   - The file is added to the Git index and committed with the message "search".
   - The commit hash of the search state (`search_hash`) is recorded.

3. **Creating the Replace State**:
   - The same text file is overwritten with `replace_text`.
   - This change is staged, committed again with the message "replace", and its commit hash (`replace_hash`) is recorded.
   
4. **Resetting to Search State**:
   - The Git repository is checked out to the commit identified by `search_hash`, effectively reverting any changes made in the replace state.

5. **Cherry-Picking Replace Changes onto Search State**:
   - A cherry-pick operation is performed, which attempts to apply the changes from the "replace" commit (`replace_hash`) onto the current state (which is still at `search_hash`).
   - This operation tries to merge the differences between the two states: search and replace.

6. **Output Handling**:
   - The function does not return any explicit value but modifies the temporary Git repository in place. If successful, it updates the state of "file.txt" with the result of the cherry-pick operation.
   
**Note**: 
- Ensure that `texts` contains valid strings to avoid runtime errors. 
- This function is intended for testing or development purposes and should not be used directly on production repositories without careful consideration.

**Output Example**: The function modifies the content of "file.txt" in the temporary Git repository according to the result of the cherry-pick operation, reflecting a blend of changes from `search_text` and `replace_text`.
## ClassDef SearchTextNotUnique
**SearchTextNotUnique**: The function of SearchTextNotUnique is to raise an exception when text being searched for is not unique during replace operations.

**attributes**: 
· None

**Code Description**: 
The `SearchTextNotUnique` class inherits from the built-in Python `ValueError` class but does not override any methods or add new attributes. This makes it a custom exception specifically designed to handle situations where text that needs to be replaced is not unique within the context of an operation.

This custom exception is used in the `apply_edits` method of the `UnifiedDiffCoder` class, which processes hunks (blocks) of changes from unified diff format. When attempting to replace a specific piece of text (`hunk`) in a file, if the same text appears more than once and cannot be uniquely identified for replacement, an instance of `SearchTextNotUnique` is raised. This helps in identifying and handling cases where the search text is ambiguous or occurs multiple times, preventing incorrect replacements.

The relationship with its callers in the project:
- The `apply_edits` method checks each hunk to ensure that the content being replaced is unique. If a non-unique search text is encountered during the replacement process, it catches the `SearchTextNotUnique` exception and logs an appropriate error message.
- In the `directly_apply_hunk` function, if the same context (before) appears more than once in the content, the operation to replace the text fails, and a `SearchTextNotUnique` exception is raised.

**Note**: 
When using this class, ensure that the search text used for replacements is unique within the scope of your operations. If the text is not unique, handle the `SearchTextNotUnique` exception appropriately in your error handling logic to avoid incorrect or incomplete file modifications.
## FunctionDef flexible_search_and_replace(texts, strategies)
**flexible_search_and_replace**: The function of `flexible_search_and_replace` is to apply a series of search/replace strategies to a given set of texts, progressively using more flexible methods if necessary.
**parameters**:
· `texts`: A collection of text strings that need to be modified according to the specified strategies.
· `strategies`: A list of tuples where each tuple contains a strategy function and its associated preprocessing functions. The strategy functions are applied in order from most literal to more flexible, while preprocessing functions prepare the texts before applying the strategies.

**Code Description**: 
The `flexible_search_and_replace` function iterates over a list of strategies and their respective preprocessing functions. For each strategy and preproc pair, it applies the preprocessing steps (e.g., stripping blank lines, adjusting relative indentation) to the input texts. Then, it attempts to apply the current strategy to the modified texts.

If a strategy successfully modifies the texts (`res` is not `None`), the function returns the result of that modification. If the preprocessing involves reversing line order or relative indentations, these transformations are reversed back after applying the strategy.

The process continues with the next strategy and preproc pair until a successful modification is found or all strategies have been exhausted. This approach allows for a flexible search and replace mechanism where increasingly complex transformations can be applied if initial attempts fail.

**Reference Relationship**: 
- The `flexible_search_and_replace` function is called by `flexi_just_search_and_replace`, which provides a simplified interface to the more complex strategy application process.
- It leverages the `try_strategy` function, which handles the actual execution of each search/replace strategy along with its preprocessing steps.

**Note**: 
1. Ensure that the input texts and strategies are well-defined to avoid unexpected behavior.
2. The order in which strategies and preprocs are applied can significantly impact the outcome, so carefully consider the sequence during implementation.
3. Preprocessing functions like `strip_blank_lines`, `relative_indent`, and `reverse_lines` should be defined elsewhere in the codebase.

**Output Example**: 
Given an input list of texts and a set of strategies that might include simple replacements or more complex transformations (like reversing lines), this function will attempt to find the most appropriate strategy to modify the texts. For example, if the first strategy fails due to insufficient flexibility but the second one succeeds after some preprocessing, it returns the modified text from the successful strategy.
## FunctionDef reverse_lines(text)
**reverse_lines**: The function of reverse_lines is to reverse the order of lines in a given text.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: text (str)
    - A string containing multiple lines separated by newline characters.

**Code Description**: 
The `reverse_lines` function takes a single input, `text`, which is expected to be a multi-line string. The function first splits the input text into individual lines using the `splitlines()` method with `keepends=True`. This ensures that each line retains its trailing newline character, preserving the original formatting when lines are reversed.

Next, the function reverses the list of lines using the `reverse()` method. Finally, it joins the reversed list back into a single string with `join()`, creating a new multi-line text where the order of lines is reversed compared to the original input.

This function is used within the context of another function called `try_strategy`. In `try_strategy`, `reverse_lines` is applied to each line in a list of texts if the `preproc_reverse` flag is set. This means that after processing the text with some strategy, `reverse_lines` can be used again to reverse the lines back to their original order if needed.

**Note**: Ensure that the input to `reverse_lines` is a multi-line string; otherwise, unexpected behavior may occur.
**Output Example**: 
If the input text is:
```
line1
line2
line3
```

The output of `reverse_lines(text)` will be:
```
line3
line2
line1
```
## FunctionDef try_strategy(texts, strategy, preproc)

## FunctionDef strip_blank_lines(texts)
**strip_blank_lines**: The function of strip_blank_lines is to remove leading and trailing blank lines from each string in a list.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: texts (list of strings)

**Code Description**: The `strip_blank_lines` function processes a list of strings by stripping any leading or trailing newline characters (`\n`) from each element. This ensures that each line within the input list is left without extra blank lines at its beginning or end.

The function achieves this by iterating over each string in the provided list and applying the `strip("\n")` method to remove any leading or trailing newlines. It then appends a newline character back to ensure that the processed strings are still properly formatted as individual lines. The modified list of strings is returned after processing all elements.

This function is particularly useful when dealing with text data where unwanted blank lines can interfere with further processing steps, such as relative indentation adjustments or reversing line order.

**Note**: Ensure that the input `texts` parameter is a list of strings to avoid type-related errors. The function assumes that each element in the list represents a separate line of text.

**Output Example**: If the input list contains lines like:
```
    \n
foo\nbar\nbaz\n
    \n
```
The output after processing by `strip_blank_lines` would be:
```
['foo\nbar\nbaz']
```
## FunctionDef read_text(fname)
**read_text**: The function of read_text is to read the contents of a file specified by `fname`.
· parameter1: fname - This parameter is a string representing the path to the file that needs to be read.
**Code Description**: 
The `read_text` function takes a single argument, `fname`, which represents the file path. It uses the `Path` class from the `pathlib` module to construct a `PosixPath` or `WindowsPath` object based on the operating system, and then calls the `.read_text()` method on this object to read the entire content of the file as a string. The function returns the content of the file.

In the context of its caller in the project, `proc`, `read_text` is used to retrieve three different types of text data: `search`, `replace`, and `original`. These texts are then processed further within the `proc` function by various strategies defined in the `strategies` list. The `read_text` function ensures that these files exist before attempting to read them, and if any of the files do not exist, it returns without performing any operations.

The relationship with its callers from a functional perspective is clear: the caller expects certain text files to be present and uses their content as input for subsequent processing steps. If any of these files are missing, the `proc` function handles this gracefully by simply returning without further action.

**Note**: Ensure that the file paths provided to `read_text` exist and are correctly formatted to avoid potential errors or unexpected behavior. The caller, `proc`, already includes error handling for `FileNotFoundError`.

**Output Example**: If the file at the path specified in `fname` exists and contains some text, `read_text` will return that text as a string. For example:
```
read_text("data/search.txt") -> "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
```

## FunctionDef colorize_result(result)
**colorize_result**: The function of `colorize_result` is to format the result string based on its content using ANSI escape codes.
**parameters**: 
· `result`: A string indicating the test outcome, such as "pass", "WRONG", or "fail".

**Code Description**: 
The `colorize_result` function takes a single parameter, `result`, which represents the outcome of a test. It uses a dictionary to map specific result strings ("pass", "WRONG", and "fail") to corresponding colored string representations using ANSI escape codes. If the input `result` is not one of these predefined values, it returns the original `result` string unchanged.

The function ensures that:
- **"pass"** is displayed with a green background and black text.
- **"WRONG"** is shown with a red background and black text.
- **"fail"** appears with a yellow background and black text.

By default, if the input `result` does not match any of these predefined values, it returns the original `result`.

This function is called within the `main` function to colorize test results before they are printed in a 2D table format. This provides visual feedback on the outcome of each test, making it easier for users to quickly identify which tests passed or failed.

**Note**: The use of ANSI escape codes makes this function platform-dependent and works best in terminals that support these codes. Ensure your terminal supports color output when using this function.

**Output Example**: 
- If `result` is "pass", the function returns "\033[102;30mpass\033[0m".
- For "WRONG", it returns "\033[101;30mWRONG\033[0m".
- And for "fail", it outputs "\033[103;30mfail\033[0m". 
If the input is any other string, such as "unknown", it simply returns "unknown" without any color formatting.

### Object: `UserAuthentication`

#### Overview

`UserAuthentication` is a critical component responsible for managing user authentication processes within the application. It ensures secure access to system resources by verifying users' credentials and authorizing their actions based on predefined roles and permissions.

#### Properties

- **username**: A string representing the unique identifier of the user.
- **passwordHash**: A string containing the hashed version of the user's password for security purposes.
- **roles**: An array of strings defining the roles associated with the user, such as "admin", "user", or "guest".
- **token**: A string representing a JWT (JSON Web Token) used to authenticate and authorize API requests.

#### Methods

1. **authenticate(username: String, password: String): Boolean**
   - **Description**: Validates the provided username and password against stored credentials.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `username`: The user's unique identifier.
     - `password`: The plain text password entered by the user.
   - **Returns**: A boolean value indicating whether authentication was successful.

2. **generateToken(user: UserAuthentication): String**
   - **Description**: Generates a JWT token for the given user, which can be used to authenticate API requests.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `user`: An instance of the `UserAuthentication` object containing the necessary information.
   - **Returns**: A string representing the generated JWT token.

3. **checkAuthorization(token: String, requiredRole: String): Boolean**
   - **Description**: Verifies if a given token is valid and whether the user associated with the token has the required role to perform an action.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `token`: The JWT token provided by the client.
     - `requiredRole`: A string representing the role that must be present in the user's roles array for authorization to succeed.
   - **Returns**: A boolean value indicating whether the user is authorized.

#### Example Usage

```python
# Create a UserAuthentication object with sample data
user = UserAuthentication(username="john_doe", passwordHash="hashed_password_123", roles=["admin"], token="sample_jwt_token")

# Authenticate a user
is_authenticated = user.authenticate("john_doe", "correct_password")
print(is_authenticated)  # Output: True

# Generate a JWT token for the user
jwt_token = user.generateToken(user)
print(jwt_token)  # Output: sample_jwt_token

# Check if the user has the admin role and is authorized to perform an action
is_authorized = user.checkAuthorization("sample_jwt_token", "admin")
print(is_authorized)  # Output: True
```

#### Best Practices

- Always use secure hashing algorithms for storing passwords.
- Implement rate limiting on authentication attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
- Ensure that tokens are securely transmitted and stored.

By following this documentation, developers can effectively integrate the `UserAuthentication` component into their applications, ensuring robust and secure user management.

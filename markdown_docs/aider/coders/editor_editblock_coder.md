### Documentation for `CustomerService`

#### Overview

`CustomerService` is a class designed to handle all customer-related operations within our application. This includes managing customer data, processing support tickets, and ensuring seamless communication between customers and support teams.

#### Class Definition

```python
class CustomerService:
    def __init__(self, database_connection):
        """
        Initializes the CustomerService instance with a database connection.
        
        :param database_connection: A database connection object used for storing and retrieving customer data.
        """
        self.database = database_connection
    
    def create_customer(self, customer_data):
        """
        Creates a new customer record in the database.
        
        :param customer_data: A dictionary containing customer information (e.g., name, email, address).
        :return: The ID of the newly created customer or None if an error occurs.
        """
        try:

    def get_support_ticket(self, customer_id, ticket_id):
        """
        Retrieves a support ticket from the database based on the provided IDs.
        
        :param customer_id: The unique identifier of the customer associated with the ticket.
        :param ticket_id: The unique identifier of the support ticket.

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error retrieving support ticket: {str(e)}")
            return None
```

#### Usage Example

```python
from database_connection import DatabaseConnection  # Assume this is a custom database connection module

# Initialize the database connection
db_conn = DatabaseConnection()

# Create an instance of CustomerService with the database connection
customer_service = CustomerService(db_conn)

# Create a new customer
new_customer_id = customer_service.create_customer({
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "address": "123 Main St"
})

if new_customer_id:
    print(f"Customer created with ID: {new_customer_id}")

# Create a support ticket for the newly created customer
ticket_id = customer_service.create_support_ticket({
    "issue_description": "Product not working as expected",
    "priority": 3
})

if ticket_id:
    print(f"Support ticket created with ID: {ticket_id}")
```

#### Notes

- Ensure that the `DatabaseConnection` module is properly configured and handles database operations securely.
- Error handling is implemented to provide feedback on failures, but it should be extended as needed for production use.
- The methods in this class assume that the database connection provides appropriate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for customer and support ticket records.

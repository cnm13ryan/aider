### FunctionDef get_edits(self)
**get_edits**: The function of get_edits is to extract and organize edits from a given content string.
**parameters**: This Function has no parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `get_edits` method processes the internal state (`self.partial_response_content`) to identify and extract edit hunks. These edits are typically represented in a unified diff format, which includes both original (ORIG) and updated (UPD) blocks of text.

1. **Initialization**: The content is assigned from `self.partial_response_content`.
2. **Diff Extraction**: The `find_diffs` function is called to parse the content into raw edits. This function handles the extraction of edit hunks, which are represented as tuples containing a file path and a hunk of text.
3. **Path Handling**: A variable `last_path` is used to store the last encountered file path. If a new path is encountered in an edit block, it updates this variable. Otherwise, it uses the previous path.
4. **Edit Construction**: Each raw edit (path, hunk) tuple is appended to the `edits` list after handling paths.

The overall process ensures that all edits are correctly identified and organized for further processing or display.

**Note**: The function assumes that the input content is in a unified diff format, which includes lines prefixed with `+`, `-`, and `@`. It also handles cases where the content might not end with a newline character by adding one if necessary.
**Output Example**: 
Given an input string like:
```
diff --git a/file1.txt b/file1.txt
index 0000000..1111111 100644
--- a/file1.txt
+++ b/file1.txt
@@ -1,3 +1,3 @@
-line1
+line1
 line2 -> updated_line2
 line3
```
The function might return:
```python
[
    ("file1.txt", "line1\nupdated_line2\n"),
]
```

## FunctionDef collapse_repeats(s)
**collapse_repeats**: The function of `collapse_repeats` is to reduce consecutive repeated characters in a string into a single character.

**Parameters**:
Â· parameter1: s (str) - The input string from which consecutive repeating characters are to be collapsed.

**Code Description**:
The function `collapse_repeats(s)` processes the input string `s` and returns a new string where all consecutive repeating characters are reduced to a single instance. This is achieved using Python's `itertools.groupby()` method, which groups adjacent elements in an iterable if they are identical.

Here's a detailed breakdown of how it works:
1. The function takes a single parameter `s`, which is expected to be a string.
2. Inside the function, `groupby(s)` is called on the input string `s`. This returns an iterator that produces pairs of consecutive characters and their group iterators.
3. A generator expression `(k for k, g in groupby(s))` iterates over these pairs, where `k` represents a character and `g` represents its group (a group of identical characters).
4. The `"".join()` method concatenates all the unique characters from the groups into a new string.

For example:
- If `s = "aaabbbccc"`, then `groupby(s)` would produce pairs like (`'a', ['a', 'a', 'a'])`, (`'b', ['b', 'b', 'b'])`, and so on.
- The generator expression `(k for k, g in groupby("aaabbbccc"))` will yield the characters `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'`.
- Finally, `"".join('abc')` results in `"abc"`.

**Note**: This function is case-sensitive. It treats uppercase and lowercase letters as distinct characters unless explicitly converted to a uniform case before calling this function.

**Output Example**: If the input string is "aaabbbccc", the output will be "abc".

## FunctionDef flexi_just_search_and_replace(texts)
**flexi_just_search_and_replace**: The function of `flexi_just_search_and_replace` is to apply a specific search-and-replace strategy to given texts.

**parameters**: 
Â· parameter1: `texts` (list) - A list containing three elements: the search text, replace text, and original text.

**Code Description**: 

The function `flexi_just_search_and_replace` serves as an entry point for applying a particular search-and-replace strategy to a set of texts. It takes a list of three strings (`texts`) as input, where each string represents the search text, replace text, and original text respectively.

First, it defines a list of strategies, which currently contains only one element: `search_and_replace` along with its associated preprocessing function. This strategy is intended to handle simple, literal replacements in the given texts.

Next, it iterates over this single strategy and applies the preprocessing functions sequentially. For each preprocessing function, it attempts to execute the search-and-replace operation using the `try_strategy` function, which is not defined within this snippet but presumably handles the actual execution of the strategy along with its preprocessing steps.

If any of these operations return a non-None value (indicating successful modification), that modified content is returned. If none of the strategies produce a result, the function returns None.

This function is called by `directly_apply_hunk` within the `udiff_coder.py` module, which processes hunks from unified diff files to apply changes directly to the original content. The `flexi_just_search_and_replace` function provides a simplified interface for applying search-and-replace operations in this context.

**Note**: 
1. Ensure that the input texts and strategies are well-defined to avoid unexpected behavior.
2. The order of preprocessing functions can significantly impact the outcome, so carefully consider their sequence during implementation.
3. The `try_strategy` function should be defined elsewhere in the codebase to handle the actual execution of each search/replace strategy.

**Output Example**: 
Given an input list of texts such as `["old_text", "new_text", "content_with_old_text"]`, if a simple replacement is applicable, the function might return `"content_with_new_text"`. If no suitable strategy can be applied due to insufficient flexibility or other issues, it will return `None`.
## FunctionDef make_new_lines_explicit(content, hunk)

auth = UserAuthentication()

# Authenticate a user
if auth.authenticate("john_doe", "secure_password"):
    session_token = auth.generateSessionToken(auth)
    
    # Validate the session token
    if auth.validateSession(session_token):
        print("Session is valid.")
    else:
        print("Invalid session token.")
else:
    print("Authentication failed.")

# Log out a user
auth.logout(auth)
```

#### Notes

- The `passwordHash` property should never be exposed or logged in plain text. Always hash and salt passwords before storing them.

This documentation provides a comprehensive understanding of the `UserAuthentication` object, its properties, methods, and usage scenarios.
## FunctionDef cleanup_pure_whitespace_lines(lines)
**cleanup_pure_whitespace_lines**: The function of `cleanup_pure_whitespace_lines` is to process a list of lines by removing pure whitespace lines and ensuring each line ends with either a newline or carriage return followed by a newline, except when the line contains only whitespace.

**Parameters**:
Â· parameter1: `lines`: A list of strings representing lines of text.

**Code Description**: The function iterates over each line in the input list. For each line, it checks if the line consists solely of whitespace using `line.strip()`. If the line is purely whitespace, it retains the original line to preserve any trailing newlines or carriage returns that might be significant for context. Otherwise, it appends the last character before a newline or carriage return (whichever comes first) to ensure each non-whitespace line ends properly.

This function plays a crucial role in preparing text lines for comparison by ensuring consistent formatting, which is essential when aligning sections of code or text files before generating diffs or unified diffs. It helps maintain accuracy and readability during the comparison process.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that the input `lines` parameter is properly formatted as a list of strings, where each string represents a line of text. This function does not modify lines containing non-whitespace characters; it only processes purely whitespace lines to prevent potential issues in subsequent processing steps like diff generation.

**Output Example**: Given an input list `["  ", "a line", "\n", "  \r\n", "another line"]`, the output would be `["  ", "a line", "\n", "another line"]`. The first and third lines are retained as they contain only whitespace, while the second and fourth lines remain unchanged.
## FunctionDef normalize_hunk(hunk)
**normalize_hunk**: The function of `normalize_hunk` is to clean up unified diff hunks by removing pure whitespace lines from both 'before' and 'after' parts and preparing them for further processing.

**Parameters**:
Â· parameter1: hunk (List[str]) - A list containing the lines of a unified diff hunk. Each line starts with either '-', '+', or ' ', indicating whether it is part of the context, deletion, or addition, respectively.
Â·

**Code Description**: The `normalize_hunk` function processes a unified diff hunk to prepare it for further operations such as search-and-replace. It takes a list of strings representing the lines of a unified diff hunk and performs the following steps:

1. **Initialization**: Two empty lists, `before` and `after`, are initialized to store the context, deletions, and additions separately.
2. **Line Processing Loop**: The function iterates over each line in the hunk:
   - It checks if the line is a context line (indicated by ' '), deletion line ('-'), or addition line ('+').
   - For context lines, it appends them to both `before` and `after`.
   - For deletion lines, it only appends them to `before`.
   - For addition lines, it only appends them to `after`.

3. **Convert Lists to Strings**: After processing all lines, the function converts the lists of strings back into single strings using `.join()`.

4. **Return Values**: The function returns a tuple containing two strings: the cleaned 'before' part and the cleaned 'after' part.

**Reference Relationship with Callers and Callees**:
- **Called by**: `UnifiedDiffCoder.apply_edits` - This method calls `normalize_hunk` to clean up hunks before applying edits. It ensures that only significant non-whitespace context lines are considered, avoiding redundant processing.
- **Calls**: `hunk_to_before_after` and `do_replace` - After cleaning the hunk with `normalize_hunk`, it may further process the cleaned parts using these methods.

**Note**: Ensure the input hunk is in a valid unified diff format to avoid unexpected behavior or errors. The function focuses on removing pure whitespace lines, which are often redundant for search-and-replace operations.

**Output Example**: Given an input hunk:
```
@@ -1,3 +1,4 @@
- line 1
+ line 2
 line 3
+ line 4
```
The function would return:
```
'line 1\nline 3'
'line 2\nline 4'
```

## FunctionDef process_fenced_block(lines, start_line_num)
**process_fenced_block**: The function of process_fenced_block is to parse and extract diff hunks from fenced blocks within a given content.
**parameters**:
Â· parameter1: lines (list) - A list of strings representing each line of the input content.
Â· parameter2: start_line_num (int) - The index of the first line in the lines list where the processing should begin.

**Code Description**: 
The `process_fenced_block` function is designed to parse and extract diff hunks from fenced blocks within a given content. It iterates through the lines starting from `start_line_num`, looking for sections enclosed by "```" markers, which typically denote code or diff blocks in Markdown. Once it finds such a block, it extracts the relevant content and processes it further.

1. **Block Extraction**: The function first identifies the start of a fenced block by checking if any line starts with "```". If found, it breaks out of the loop.
2. **Hunk Construction**: It then constructs a list `block` containing lines from `start_line_num` up to (but not including) the line that contains "```".
3. **File Path Extraction**: The function checks if the first two lines in `block` start with "--- " and "+++ ", respectively, which are common prefixes for diff files. If so, it extracts the file path from the second line.
4. **Diff Processing**: It then processes each line within the block to identify hunks (sections of changes) denoted by lines starting with "- ", "+ ", or "@@". For each hunk, it records the file name and the content of the hunk in the `edits` list.

The function returns a tuple containing the next line number where processing should continue (`line_num + 1`) and the list of processed edits (`edits`).

**Note**: The function assumes that the input lines are split by newlines, which is typical for text files. It also handles cases where the file paths might contain spaces.

**Output Example**: 
```python
line_number, edits = process_fenced_block(["--- file.py", "+++ file.py", "-def old_function():", "+def new_function():", "@@ -1 +1 @@"], 0)
# Output: (4, [('file.py', ['+def new_function():'])])
```
In this example, the function processes a block starting from line `0`, identifies the diff hunks, and returns the next line number to process (`4`) along with the list of edits.
## FunctionDef hunk_to_before_after(hunk, lines)
**hunk_to_before_after**: The function of hunk_to_before_after is to split a unified diff hunk into 'before' and 'after' parts.
**parameters**: 
Â· parameter1: hunk (List[str]) - A list containing the lines of the unified diff hunk. Each line starts with either '-', '+', or ' ' indicating whether it's a context, addition, or deletion line respectively.
Â· parameter2: lines (bool) - Optional flag to indicate if the function should return lists of strings rather than joined strings. Default is False.

**Code Description**: The `hunk_to_before_after` function takes a unified diff hunk and splits it into two parts: 'before' and 'after'. This process involves parsing each line in the hunk, determining whether it belongs to the context (starting with ' '), additions (starting with '+'), or deletions (starting with '-'). The lines are then aggregated to form the 'before' and 'after' strings. If the `lines` parameter is set to True, the function returns lists of individual lines instead.

The function plays a crucial role in several parts of the unified diff processing pipeline:
- In `normalize_hunk`, it helps clean up the hunk by removing pure whitespace lines from both before and after sections.
- In `make_new_lines_explicit`, it is used to generate new hunks based on the differences between the cleaned 'before' content and the original 'after' content.
- In `directly_apply_hunk` and related functions, it helps in applying changes directly by separating context from additions and deletions.

The function ensures that only non-whitespace context lines are considered significant for search-and-replace operations, thereby avoiding redundant processing on purely whitespace contexts. This is particularly useful when dealing with large hunks where repeated searches could be computationally expensive.

**Note**: Ensure the hunk provided has a valid unified diff format to avoid unexpected behavior or errors.
**Output Example**: If given a hunk:
```
@@ -1,3 +1,4 @@
- line 1
+ line 2
 line 3
+ line 4
```
The function would return:
```
'line 1\nline 3'
'line 2\nline 4'
```

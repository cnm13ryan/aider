## ClassDef WholeFileFunctionCoder
### Object: User Authentication System

#### Overview
The User Authentication System is a critical component of our software application designed to manage user authentication processes securely and efficiently. This system ensures that only authorized users can access specific features or data within the application.

#### Key Features
1. **User Registration**
   - Allows new users to create accounts by providing necessary personal information.
   
2. **Login Verification**
   - Validates user credentials (username/email and password) against a secure database.
   
3. **Password Management**
   - Supports password reset functionalities, including email verification and temporary password generation.
   
4. **Session Management**
   - Manages active sessions to ensure that users are logged out after a period of inactivity or when explicitly logged out.

5. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Implements RBAC to grant different levels of access based on user roles, ensuring data and functionality are accessible only to authorized personnel.

#### Technical Specifications
- **Database Schema:**
  - `users` table: Contains columns such as `user_id`, `username`, `email`, `password_hash`, `role`, and `status`.
  
- **API Endpoints:**
  - `/register`: POST request for user registration.
  - `/login`: POST request for user login verification.
  - `/logout`: POST request to end a user's session.
  - `/reset-password`: POST request to initiate password reset process.

#### Security Measures
- **Password Hashing:** User passwords are hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database.
- **Secure Communication:** All communication between the client and server uses HTTPS for encrypted data transmission.
- **Rate Limiting:** To prevent brute-force attacks, rate limiting is applied to login attempts.

#### Usage Guidelines
1. Ensure that all user information entered during registration or login is accurate to avoid account lockouts or unauthorized access.
2. Regularly update passwords to enhance security and follow the password reset process if a password is forgotten.
3. Logout from active sessions when ending use of the application to prevent unauthorized access.

#### Maintenance and Support
- **Documentation:** This document provides detailed information on how to interact with the User Authentication System.
- **Support:** For any issues or questions regarding authentication, contact the IT support team at [support@company.com].

By adhering to these guidelines and using the provided features effectively, users can ensure a secure and seamless experience within the application.
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of WholeFileFunctionCoder.
**parameters**: This method does not accept any parameters explicitly defined here.

**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` method serves as the constructor for the `WholeFileFunctionCoder` class. It currently includes a call to raise a `RuntimeError`, indicating that this class is deprecated and needs refactoring. The method then initializes an instance of `WholeFileFunctionPrompts` using the `gpt_prompts` attribute, which likely contains prompts or instructions used by GPT models for generating code edits. Finally, it calls the superclass's constructor using `super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)`, ensuring that any necessary initialization from the parent class is performed.

The use of `*args` and `**kwargs` in both the method signature and the call to the superclass constructor suggests a flexible design that can accept varying numbers and types of arguments. However, since this method raises an error, it is unlikely that these parameters are intended for direct usage by developers.

This method also highlights the importance of maintaining backward compatibility while refactoring deprecated code, as seen through the use of `super().__init__`.

**Note**: Developers should be aware that using this class directly will result in a runtime error. Instead, they should focus on implementing or adapting the necessary functionality to align with the updated requirements.

### FunctionDef update_cur_messages(self, edited)
**update_cur_messages**: The function of update_cur_messages is to add new messages to the current message list based on whether an edit has been made.

**parameters**:
Â· edited: A boolean value indicating whether a text edit has been performed.

**Code Description**:
The `update_cur_messages` method updates the `cur_messages` attribute by appending a new dictionary entry representing an assistant's response. The structure of this dictionary is predefined and consists of two key-value pairs:

1. **role**: This is always set to "assistant", indicating that the message originates from the system or AI.
2. **content**: Depending on whether an edit has been made, the content will differ:
   - If `edited` is True, the method appends a dictionary with the content derived from `self.gpt_prompts.redacted_edit_message`. This likely represents a response generated by an AI after processing a redacted or modified input.
   - If `edited` is False (meaning no edit has been made), the method appends a dictionary with the content derived from `self.partial_response_content`. This could represent a default or previous response that was not altered.

This function ensures that the message list (`cur_messages`) reflects the current state of the interaction, whether there has been an update or not. It helps maintain the context and flow of conversation by dynamically adjusting the messages based on user actions (or lack thereof).

**Note**: Ensure that `self.gpt_prompts.redacted_edit_message` and `self.partial_response_content` are properly defined elsewhere in your class to avoid runtime errors. These attributes should provide appropriate content for the assistant's response, depending on whether an edit has been made.

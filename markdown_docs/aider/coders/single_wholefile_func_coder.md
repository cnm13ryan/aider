### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the SingleWholeFileFunctionCoder instance.
**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 args: Variable length argument list.
路 kwargs: Arbitrary keyword arguments.

**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` method initializes an instance of the `SingleWholeFileFunctionCoder` class. It primarily performs two key actions:
1. **Initialization of GPT Prompts**: It creates an instance of `SingleWholeFileFunctionPrompts`, which is a class that defines prompts for generating code using AI. This setup ensures that the coder has predefined instructions and templates to follow when making changes.
2. **Inheritance Initialization**: By calling `super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)`, it initializes any parent or base class attributes and methods, ensuring that all necessary initializations from the superclass are performed.

The method receives a variable number of positional (`*args`) and keyword (`**kwargs`) arguments to allow flexibility in its usage. These arguments can be used to pass additional parameters required by the superclass during initialization.

This method is crucial for setting up the coder with the appropriate prompts and ensuring that it is ready to handle requests for code changes, leveraging AI-generated responses appropriately.

**Note**: Ensure that `SingleWholeFileFunctionPrompts` is correctly defined and available in the project. The use of `super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)` implies that this class extends another class, so make sure the parent class initialization aligns with the needs of your implementation.
***
### FunctionDef update_cur_messages(self, edited)
**update_cur_messages**: The function of update_cur_messages is to add new assistant messages to the current list based on whether an edit has been made.

**parameters**:
路 parameter1: edited (bool)
    - If `edited` is True, it indicates that a change has been made and a specific redacted message will be added.
    - If `edited` is False, a different partial response content will be appended to the current list of messages.

**Code Description**: 
The function `update_cur_messages` updates the current list of messages (`self.cur_messages`) by appending new assistant messages depending on whether an edit has been made. Here are the detailed steps:

1. **Condition Check**: The function first checks if the parameter `edited` is True.
2. **Adding Redacted Message**:
    - If `edited` is True, a dictionary representing a new message with role "assistant" and content from `self.gpt_prompts.redacted_edit_message` is appended to `self.cur_messages`.
3. **Adding Partial Response Content**:
    - If `edited` is False, another dictionary is added to the list where the role is "assistant" and the content comes from `self.partial_response_content`.

This function ensures that the messages in the current context are updated appropriately based on whether an edit has been performed or not. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where the system needs to log different types of responses depending on user interactions.

**Note**: Ensure that `self.gpt_prompts.redacted_edit_message` and `self.partial_response_content` are properly defined within the class for this function to work correctly. Any changes made should reflect accurately in these attributes for consistent behavior.
***
### FunctionDef render_incremental_response(self, final)
**render_incremental_response**: The function of render_incremental_response is to construct an incremental response string based on partial response content and parsed arguments.
**Parameters**:
路 final: A boolean indicating whether this is the final part of the incremental response.

**Code Description**: 
The `render_incremental_response` method constructs a string that represents an incremental response, which can be used in scenarios where responses are generated incrementally over multiple calls. This function primarily handles two main tasks: appending existing partial content and formatting parsed arguments into a readable format.
1. **Initial Content Check**: The first line of the function checks if there is any `partial_response_content` available. If so, it appends this content to the result string (`res`).
2. **Argument Parsing**: Next, the method calls `parse_partial_args()` to extract arguments from the partial response content. This step ensures that only valid and correctly formatted arguments are processed.
3. **Formatting Arguments**: If no arguments are found (i.e., `args` is empty), an empty string is returned immediately. Otherwise, for each key-value pair in the parsed arguments (`args.items()`):
   - A newline character is added to separate different sections.
   - The key and a colon are printed.
   - The corresponding value is appended.
4. **Return Value**: Finally, the constructed string `res` is returned.

**Note**: This function assumes that the `partial_response_function_call` contains valid JSON-formatted data or can be coerced into JSON through various error-tolerant parsing methods. It handles potential JSON decoding errors by attempting to fix malformed JSON strings incrementally.
**Output Example**: If `self.partial_response_content` is "Part1" and `args` contains {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}, the output might be:
```
Part1
key1:
value1
key2:
value2
```

# Documentation for `UserAuthenticationService`

## Overview

The `UserAuthenticationService` is a critical component of our application that handles user authentication and authorization processes. It ensures secure login, logout, and session management functionalities. This service interacts with both the database to verify user credentials and external security services if required.

## Key Features

- **Secure Login:** Validates user credentials against the database.
- **Logout Functionality:** Terminates user sessions and clears tokens.
- **Session Management:** Tracks active user sessions for real-time updates.
- **Error Handling:** Provides detailed error messages for troubleshooting issues.

## Usage

### Initialization

To initialize the `UserAuthenticationService`, you need to configure it with necessary dependencies such as database connection, logger, and any external security services.

```python
from authentication_service import UserAuthenticationService

auth_service = UserAuthenticationService(db_connection, logger, security_provider)
```

### Methods

#### `authenticate_user(username: str, password: str) -> bool`

Verifies the provided username and password against the database. Returns `True` if the credentials are valid, otherwise returns `False`.

```python
result = auth_service.authenticate_user('john_doe', 'secure_password123')
print(result)  # Output will be True or False based on the credentials.
```

#### `logout_user(user_id: int) -> None`

Logs out a specific user by invalidating their session token and updating the database.

```python
auth_service.logout_user(101)
```

#### `get_active_sessions(user_id: int) -> List[SessionInfo]`

Retrieves information about active sessions for a given user ID.

```python
sessions = auth_service.get_active_sessions(101)
for session in sessions:
    print(session.session_id, session.expiry_time)
```

### Error Handling

The `UserAuthenticationService` returns detailed error messages when authentication fails. These errors can be caught and handled appropriately by the calling application.

```python
try:
    auth_service.authenticate_user('invalid_user', 'wrong_password')
except AuthenticationException as e:
    print(e)  # Output: Invalid username or password.
```

## Configuration

The `UserAuthenticationService` requires several configuration parameters to function correctly. These include database connection details, logger settings, and any external security services.

```python
config = {
    "db_connection": db_connection,
    "logger": logger,
    "security_provider": security_provider
}

auth_service = UserAuthenticationService(config)
```

## Best Practices

- Ensure that sensitive information such as passwords is handled securely.
- Regularly update and patch the service to address any security vulnerabilities.
- Implement comprehensive logging for auditing and debugging purposes.

## Dependencies

The `UserAuthenticationService` relies on the following external dependencies:

- Database connection object (`db_connection`)
- Logger instance (`logger`)
- Security provider interface or class (`security_provider`)

## Support and Maintenance

For support, please refer to our official documentation or contact the support team at [support@example.com]. Updates and patches will be released as needed, and detailed changelogs are available in the release notes.

### FunctionDef apply_edits(self, edits)
**apply_edits**: The function of apply_edits is to update files based on provided edits.
**parameters**:
路 edits: A list of tuples where each tuple contains a file path (relative or absolute) and the new content as a string.

**Code Description**: 
The `apply_edits` method iterates over a list of edits, applying each edit to its corresponding file. For each edit in the provided list, it constructs an absolute path using the relative path from the edits and writes the new content to that file.

1. **Iterate Through Edits**: The function starts by iterating through the `edits` parameter, which is expected to be a list of tuples. Each tuple consists of two elements: a file path (relative or absolute) and the new content as a string.
2. **Construct Absolute Path**: For each edit, it constructs an absolute path using the `abs_root_path` method from the current class instance (`self`). The `abs_root_path` method ensures that the relative path is converted to an absolute path based on the root directory of the coder.
3. **Write New Content**: Using the constructed absolute path and the new content, it writes the updated content to the file using the `write_text` method from the `io` object.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the provided edits are valid and contain the correct paths and content before calling this function. Incorrect or invalid inputs can lead to errors.
- The `abs_root_path_cache` is used to cache previously computed absolute paths, which improves performance by avoiding redundant computation for repeated paths.

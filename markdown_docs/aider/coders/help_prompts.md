# Documentation for `DatabaseConnectionManager`

## Overview

`DatabaseConnectionManager` is a critical component of our application designed to handle database connections efficiently and securely. It ensures that database interactions are optimized, reducing the likelihood of connection leaks or other issues.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of `DatabaseConnectionManager` is to provide a robust and reusable mechanism for managing database connections. This includes establishing connections, executing queries, and ensuring proper closure of connections after operations are complete.

## Key Features

1. **Connection Pooling**: Manages a pool of database connections to minimize the overhead associated with creating new connections.
2. **Error Handling**: Implements robust error handling mechanisms to ensure that any issues during connection or query execution are properly managed and logged.
3. **Configuration Management**: Supports dynamic configuration of database settings such as host, port, username, and password through a configuration file or environment variables.

## Usage

### Initializing the Manager

To use `DatabaseConnectionManager`, you first need to initialize it with necessary parameters:

```python
from db_manager import DatabaseConnectionManager

# Initialize the manager with connection details
connection_details = {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 5432,
    "username": "user",
    "password": "pass",
    "database": "test_db"
}

db_manager = DatabaseConnectionManager(connection_details)
```

### Executing Queries

Once initialized, you can use the `execute_query` method to run SQL queries:

```python
# Execute a simple SELECT query
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE active = true;"
result = db_manager.execute_query(query)

for row in result:
    print(row)
```

### Closing Connections

Ensure that connections are properly closed after operations to avoid resource leaks:

```python
db_manager.close_connections()
```

## Configuration

Configuration can be set through a configuration file or environment variables. The recommended approach is to use a `.env` file for sensitive information like database credentials.

Example of a `.env` file:
```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=user
DB_PASSWORD=pass
DB_NAME=test_db
```

In the code, you can load these settings as follows:

```python
import os

connection_details = {
    "host": os.getenv("DB_HOST"),
    "port": int(os.getenv("DB_PORT")),
    "username": os.getenv("DB_USER"),
    "password": os.getenv("DB_PASSWORD"),
    "database": os.getenv("DB_NAME")
}

db_manager = DatabaseConnectionManager(connection_details)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Connection Pooling**: Always use connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently.
2. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling to ensure that any issues are caught and logged appropriately.
3. **Resource Management**: Ensure that all database connections are properly closed after operations to prevent resource leaks.

## Dependencies

- `psycopg2` for PostgreSQL database interactions
- `configparser` or similar library for configuration management

## Example Use Case

```python
from db_manager import DatabaseConnectionManager

# Initialize the manager with connection details from a .env file
connection_details = {
    "host": os.getenv("DB_HOST"),
    "port": int(os.getenv("DB_PORT")),
    "username": os.getenv("DB_USER"),
    "password": os.getenv("DB_PASSWORD"),
    "database": os.getenv("DB_NAME")
}

db_manager = DatabaseConnectionManager(connection_details)

# Execute a query to retrieve all active users
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE active = true;"
result = db_manager.execute_query(query)

for row in result:
    print(row)

# Close the connections to free up resources
db_manager.close_connections()
```

## Conclusion

`DatabaseConnectionManager` is an essential tool for managing database interactions within your application. By leveraging its features, you can ensure efficient and reliable data access while maintaining best practices for resource management and error handling.

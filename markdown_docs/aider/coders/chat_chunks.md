## ClassDef ChatChunks
**ChatChunks**: The function of ChatChunks is to manage and organize various types of chat messages into different categories.

**Attributes**:
· system: A list that stores system-related messages.
· examples: A list that contains example messages, typically used for demonstration purposes.
· done: A list that holds completed or finalized messages.
· repo: A list that includes repository-related messages.
· readonly_files: A list of read-only file messages.
· chat_files: A list containing chat-related files' messages.
· cur: A current message list which might be the latest interaction context.
· reminder: A list for reminders.

**Code Description**: The `ChatChunks` class is designed to organize and manage various types of chat messages, ensuring they are categorized appropriately. It provides methods to combine all messages into a single collection, add cache control headers to certain messages, and determine which messages can be cached based on their content.

The `all_messages()` method concatenates multiple lists of messages (system, examples, done, repo, readonly_files, chat_files, cur, reminder) into one comprehensive list. This is useful for generating a complete conversation history or context that needs to be displayed or processed together.

The `add_cache_control_headers()` method adds cache control headers to certain message categories based on their availability. It first checks if there are any example messages and applies caching rules accordingly. If no examples are available, it falls back to applying caching to system-related messages. Similarly, it handles repository messages and readonly files, ensuring that appropriate caching directives are added.

The `add_cache_control()` method specifically adds cache control headers to the last message in a given list of messages. It ensures that if the content is just a string, it converts it into a structured format before applying cache control settings. This helps in managing how different types of chat messages are cached by external systems or services.

The `cacheable_messages()` method returns all messages that have been marked as cacheable based on their content. It iterates through the combined list of messages and applies caching rules to determine which ones can be safely cached without causing issues such as stale data.

**Note**: When using this class, ensure that all message lists are properly initialized before calling any methods. Also, note that the caching behavior is dependent on the specific implementation details provided by the `main_model` object used in the project.

**Output Example**: The output of the `all_messages()` method would be a combined list of messages from different categories such as system, examples, done, repo, readonly_files, chat_files, cur, and reminder. For instance:
```python
[
    {"role": "system", "content": "..."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "..."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."},
    # ... other messages ...
]
```

The `cacheable_messages()` method would return a subset of these messages that are marked as cacheable, based on their content and the caching rules defined.

### FunctionDef add_cache_control_headers(self)
**add_cache_control_headers**: The function of `add_cache_control_headers` is to add cache control headers to various types of content in a chat session.

**parameters**: 
· parameter1: `self`: The instance of the `ChatChunks` class.

**Code Description**: 

The `add_cache_control_headers` method ensures that different parts of a chat session are appropriately cached. It performs this by adding cache control settings to several types of content, including examples, system messages, repository-related data, readonly files, and chat files.

1. **Examples Handling**: If the `examples` attribute is not empty, it calls `add_cache_control` on the `examples`. Otherwise, it processes the `system` attribute using `add_cache_control`.

2. **Repository Data Handling**: The method checks if the `repo` attribute is present. If so, it uses `add_cache_control` to process both the `readonly_files` and the `repomap` chunk. This ensures that these parts of the repository data are cacheable.

3. **Fallback for ReadOnly Files**: If the `repo` attribute is not available, it processes only the `readonly_files` using `add_cache_control`.

4. **Chat Files Handling**: Finally, it calls `add_cache_control` on the `chat_files` to ensure that these files are appropriately cached.

The method relies on the `add_cache_control` function to add cache control headers to the content of each specified attribute. This caching behavior is crucial for managing how different parts of a chat session are handled by the system, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval while maintaining the integrity and freshness of the data.

**Note**: Ensure that all attributes such as `examples`, `system`, `repo`, `readonly_files`, and `chat_files` contain valid content. If any of these attributes do not exist or are empty, the method will handle them according to the defined logic, ensuring that appropriate cache control headers are added where necessary.

This function is called by the `format_messages` method in the `base_coder.py` module, which formats and processes messages before returning them. The `format_messages` method first calls `add_cache_control_headers` to ensure all relevant content has proper caching settings before finalizing the message format.
***
### FunctionDef add_cache_control(self, messages)
**add_cache_control**: The function of `add_cache_control` is to add cache control settings to the last message content in a list of messages.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: `messages`: A list containing message dictionaries.

**Code Description**: 
The `add_cache_control` method processes a list of message dictionaries, adding cache control headers to the content of the last message in the list. If the content is already a dictionary and not of type "text", it converts the content into a text-type dictionary with the original content as its text field. It then adds an ephemeral cache control setting to this dictionary.

The method first checks if `messages` is empty; if so, it returns immediately without making any changes. If the list contains messages, it retrieves the content of the last message in the list and checks whether the content is a string. If it is, the function converts the content into a dictionary with keys "type" set to "text" and "text" set to the original content value.

Next, an ephemeral cache control setting is added to this content dictionary under the key "cache_control". Finally, the updated content dictionary replaces the existing content of the last message in `messages`.

This method is called within other methods that handle different types of messages or files, ensuring appropriate caching behavior for various parts of a chat session. For instance, it is used in `add_cache_control_headers` to add cache control settings to examples, system messages, repository-related data, readonly_files, and chat_files.

**Note**: Ensure the input parameter `messages` is always a list containing message dictionaries; otherwise, unexpected behavior may occur.
**Output Example**: 
If the last message content was "Hello", after calling `add_cache_control`, the updated message might look like this:
```python
{
    "content": {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "Hello",
        "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}
    }
}
```
***
### FunctionDef cacheable_messages(self)
**cacheable_messages**: The function of `cacheable_messages` is to return messages that are cacheable based on specific conditions.
**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The `cacheable_messages` method iterates over the reversed order of all cached messages. It checks if the content of each message is a list and whether this list contains an element with "cache_control". If such a condition is met, it returns a slice of the original messages up to the point where the first cacheable message was found (excluding that message). Otherwise, it returns all messages.

The function interacts with the `all_messages` method from the same class, which concatenates various lists of messages. This ensures that the `cacheable_messages` method works on a comprehensive list of cached messages.

**Note**: 
- The function assumes that the structure of the messages is consistent and predictable.
- The "cache_control" attribute must be present in the content for a message to be considered cacheable.
- The method relies on the order of messages being reversed, so any changes to this order could affect its behavior.

**Output Example**: 
Suppose we have the following messages:
```python
messages = [
    {"content": ["message1", {"cache_control": "public"}]},
    {"content": ["message2"]},
    {"content": ["message3"]}
]
```
The `cacheable_messages` method would return a list containing only the first message, as it is the only one with cache control information:
```python
["message1"]
```

In another scenario where no messages have "cache_control" set, the function will return an empty list or all messages if none are cacheable.

### Documentation for `UserAuthenticationService`

#### Overview

The `UserAuthenticationService` is a critical component of our application responsible for managing user authentication processes. This service ensures secure access to system resources by verifying user credentials and maintaining session states.

#### Purpose

- **Secure Authentication:** Facilitates secure login and logout processes.
- **Session Management:** Manages user sessions, ensuring that only authenticated users have access to protected areas.
- **Audit Logging:** Tracks authentication attempts for security and auditing purposes.

#### Key Methods

1. **`login(username: string, password: string): Promise<User>`**
   - **Description:** Authenticates a user based on provided username and password.
   - **Parameters:**
     - `username (string)`: The unique identifier of the user attempting to log in.
     - `password (string)`: The user's password used for authentication.
   - **Returns:**
     - A `Promise<User>` that resolves with a user object containing relevant information if the login is successful, or rejects with an error message if the credentials are invalid.

2. **`logout(userId: string): Promise<void>`**
   - **Description:** Logs out a user by invalidating their session.
   - **Parameters:**
     - `userId (string)`: The unique identifier of the user to log out.
   - **Returns:**
     - A `Promise<void>` that resolves when the logout process is complete.

3. **`checkSessionValidity(userId: string): Promise<boolean>`**
   - **Description:** Verifies if a user's session is still valid.
   - **Parameters:**
     - `userId (string)`: The unique identifier of the user to check.
   - **Returns:**
     - A `Promise<boolean>` that resolves with `true` if the session is valid, or `false` otherwise.

4. **`logAuthenticationAttempt(username: string, success: boolean): void`**
   - **Description:** Logs an authentication attempt for auditing purposes.
   - **Parameters:**
     - `username (string)`: The username of the user attempting to log in.
     - `success (boolean)`: Indicates whether the login was successful (`true`) or not (`false`).
   - **Returns:**
     - No return value.

#### Usage Example

```typescript
import { UserAuthenticationService } from './UserAuthenticationService';

const authenticationService = new UserAuthenticationService();

// Attempt to log in a user
authenticationService.login('john.doe', 'password123')
  .then(user => {
    console.log(`Login successful for user: ${user.username}`);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(`Login failed: ${error.message}`);
  });

// Log out the same user
authenticationService.logout('john.doe')
  .then(() => {
    console.log('User logged out successfully.');
  });

// Check session validity
authenticationService.checkSessionValidity('john.doe')
  .then(isValid => {
    if (isValid) {
      console.log('Session is valid.');
    } else {
      console.log('Session is invalid.');
    }
  });
```

#### Dependencies

- `crypto`: For secure hashing and encryption.
- `database`: For storing and retrieving user credentials.

#### Security Considerations

- **Password Hashing:** User passwords are hashed using a strong cryptographic hash function before being stored in the database.
- **Secure Sessions:** Sessions are managed securely, with session tokens being encrypted and stored in cookies or local storage.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.

#### Error Handling

- The `login` method returns an error if the provided credentials are invalid.
- The `logout` method handles cases where the user ID is not found by returning a generic error message.

By following this documentation, developers can effectively use and maintain the `UserAuthenticationService` to ensure secure and reliable authentication processes in our application.

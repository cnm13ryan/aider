### FunctionDef get_edits(self, mode)
**get_edits**: The function of get_edits is to return an empty list.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: mode (default value: "update")
**Code Description**: This method is designed to retrieve edits or changes based on the specified mode. By default, it returns an empty list regardless of the mode provided. The `mode` parameter can be set to different values depending on the context in which this function is used, but currently, it does not affect the output as the function always returns an empty list.
**Note**: Although the `mode` parameter is included, its current implementation has no impact on the return value. Ensure that any future changes or modes are properly handled and documented to avoid confusion.
**Output Example**: The method will always return an empty list: `[]`.

### FunctionDef apply_edits(self, edits)
**apply_edits**: The function of apply_edits is to apply a set of edits to an existing piece of text or code.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: edits (list[Edit], required) - A list of edit objects that contain instructions on how to modify the input text or code.

**Code Description**:
The `apply_edits` method within the `HelpCoder` class is responsible for processing a series of edit operations on some form of input, typically textual content. This function receives a parameter named `edits`, which is expected to be a list of objects that each represent an individual editing operation.

Each object in this list should contain enough information to specify what kind of change needs to be made (e.g., insertions, deletions, replacements) and where within the input text or code these changes need to occur. The implementation of how these edits are applied is left as a placeholder (`pass`), indicating that the specific logic for applying each edit will be defined elsewhere in the class.

The method signature suggests that `apply_edits` could be part of a larger system designed to automate the process of making multiple modifications to documents or codebases, such as during the development and testing phases where frequent changes are necessary. For example, it might be used in an automated refactoring tool or a document management system.

**Note**: Ensure that each edit object within the `edits` list is properly formatted and contains all required information before passing it to this method. The exact structure of these objects should match what your application expects, as any mismatch will result in undefined behavior.

### Object: `UserAuthenticationService`

#### Overview

The `UserAuthenticationService` is a critical component of our application responsible for managing user authentication processes. This service handles user login, logout, registration, and session management. It ensures that users can securely access the system while maintaining data integrity and user privacy.

#### Responsibilities

1. **Login**: Facilitates secure user login by validating credentials against the database.
2. **Logout**: Terminates a user's active session and clears any stored session data.
3. **Registration**: Registers new users in the system, ensuring that all necessary validation checks are performed.
4. **Session Management**: Manages user sessions to track their activity within the application.

#### Methods

1. **Login**
   - **Purpose**: Validate a user's credentials for login.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `username` (string): The username provided by the user.
     - `password` (string): The password provided by the user.
   - **Returns**:
     - `boolean`: True if the login is successful, False otherwise.
   - **Example Usage**:
     ```python
     result = UserAuthenticationService.login("john_doe", "securepassword123")
     print(result)  # Output: True or False based on credentials
     ```

2. **Logout**
   - **Purpose**: Terminate a user's active session.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `session_id` (string): The unique identifier of the current session.
   - **Returns**:
     - `boolean`: True if the logout is successful, False otherwise.
   - **Example Usage**:
     ```python
     result = UserAuthenticationService.logout("123456")
     print(result)  # Output: True or False based on session validity
     ```

3. **Register**
   - **Purpose**: Register a new user in the system.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `username` (string): The username to be used for the new account.
     - `password` (string): The password to secure the new account.
     - `email` (string): The email address associated with the new account.
   - **Returns**:
     - `boolean`: True if the registration is successful, False otherwise.
   - **Example Usage**:
     ```python
     result = UserAuthenticationService.register("jane_doe", "securepassword123", "jane.doe@example.com")
     print(result)  # Output: True or False based on successful registration
     ```

4. **GetActiveSessions**
   - **Purpose**: Retrieve the list of active sessions for a given user.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `user_id` (string): The unique identifier of the user.
   - **Returns**:
     - `list[Session]`: A list of session objects representing the current active sessions.
   - **Example Usage**:
     ```python
     active_sessions = UserAuthenticationService.getActiveSessions("123456")
     print(active_sessions)  # Output: List of session objects
     ```

#### Security Considerations

- The service uses secure hashing algorithms to store and validate passwords.
- All communication between the client and server is encrypted using TLS/SSL.
- Session tokens are securely generated and stored.

#### Error Handling

The `UserAuthenticationService` includes robust error handling mechanisms to manage invalid inputs, failed authentication attempts, and other potential issues. Detailed error messages are logged for debugging purposes but not exposed to end-users.

#### Dependencies

- Database Service: For storing and retrieving user credentials.
- Session Management Service: For tracking and managing active sessions.
- Encryption Library: For securing data during transmission and storage.

#### Best Practices

1. **Use Strong Passwords**: Encourage users to create strong, unique passwords.
2. **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular security audits to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
3. **Session Expiry**: Implement session expiry mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access in case of a compromised session token.

## ClassDef MissingAPIKeyError
**MissingAPIKeyError**: The function of MissingAPIKeyError is to raise an error when an API key is missing.

**Attributes**: This class does not define any additional attributes beyond those inherited from its parent class `ValueError`.

**Code Description**: 
The `MissingAPIKeyError` class is a subclass of the built-in Python `ValueError` exception. It inherits all properties and methods from `ValueError`. The only action taken in this class is to inherit the behavior provided by `ValueError`, which means that when an instance of `MissingAPIKeyError` is raised, it behaves exactly like any other `ValueError`.

In essence, `MissingAPIKeyError` serves as a custom exception type for scenarios where an API key is required but not provided. This can be particularly useful in coding environments where you want to distinguish between different types of errors that might occur due to missing or invalid input.

For example, if a function requires an API key to make a request and the user fails to provide one, raising `MissingAPIKeyError` would help in identifying this specific error type more clearly compared to simply using `ValueError`.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that wherever you raise `MissingAPIKeyError`, it is appropriately caught and handled. This custom exception can be caught with a standard `except ValueError:` block.
- The name `MissingAPIKeyError` suggests that the primary use case would involve API interactions, but this class could also be used in any context where a specific type of error needs to be distinguished from other errors.

## FunctionDef wrap_fence(name)
**wrap_fence**: The function of wrap_fence is to create HTML tag wrappers for a given name.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: name (str) - The name or tag name used to generate the opening and closing HTML tags.

**Code Description**: 
The `wrap_fence` function takes a single string argument, `name`, which represents an HTML tag name. It returns a tuple containing two strings: an opening HTML tag (`<name>`) and a corresponding closing HTML tag (`</name>`). This is useful for generating basic HTML structures dynamically.

Here's a detailed analysis of the code:
- The function definition begins with `def wrap_fence(name):`, indicating that it accepts one parameter, `name`.
- Inside the function, an f-string is used to construct the opening tag: `f"<{name}>"`. This string concatenates the literal `<` and the value of the `name` parameter.
- Similarly, another f-string constructs the closing tag: `f"</{name}>"`, which combines the literal `</` with the `name` parameter to form a properly closed HTML tag.
- The function returns these two strings as a tuple using the comma operator.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the provided `name` is a valid and appropriate tag name for your application context. Improper use can lead to invalid or malformed HTML.
- This function assumes that the input `name` will not contain any characters that need special escaping in HTML, such as `<`, `>`, etc.

**Output Example**: 
If you call `wrap_fence("div")`, it would return `("<div>", "</div>")`.

### FunctionDef clone(self)
**clone**: The function of clone is to create a new Coder instance based on an existing one while optionally updating certain attributes.
**parameters**:
· self: The current instance of the Coder class from which the new coder will be cloned.
· **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments that can override or update properties of the new coder.

**Code Description**: 
The `clone` method in the `Coder` class is designed to create a deep copy of an existing coder, allowing for the creation of similar instances with potential modifications. This method primarily involves creating a new instance using the `create` method and then copying specific attributes from the original coder to the new one.

1. **Creation of New Coder Instance**: The method first calls the `create` method on the current class (`self.create`). The `create` method is responsible for setting up a new coder with default or specified parameters, effectively creating a fresh instance.
   
2. **Property Copying**: After the new coder instance is created, the method copies several key attributes from the original coder to the new one:
   - `ignore_mentions`: This attribute is directly copied over from the original coder to ensure that any specific mention filtering rules are preserved in the cloned coder.

3. **Return of New Coder Instance**: Finally, the method returns the newly created coder instance, allowing it to be used independently or with modified attributes as needed.

This approach ensures that new coders can inherit properties and context from existing ones while providing flexibility through the `kwargs` parameter for customization.

**Note**: The `clone` method assumes that the `create` method is capable of setting up a basic coder instance, which may include default configurations or specific parameters. Users should ensure that the `create` method is properly defined to meet their needs when using this cloning functionality.

**Output Example**: 
```python
original_coder = Coder(...)
new_coder = original_coder.clone(ignore_mentions=["example1", "example2"])
```
In this example, a new coder instance (`new_coder`) is created based on the `original_coder`, but with specific mention filtering rules applied to it.

### FunctionDef drop_rel_fname(self, fname)
**drop_rel_fname**: The function of drop_rel_fname is to remove a relative file name from a list of absolute file names.
**parameters**: 
· fname: The relative file name to be removed.

**Code Description**: 
The `drop_rel_fname` method is designed to manage the removal of specific file entries within an object's state. It takes a relative file name (`fname`) as input and removes it from the list of absolute file names stored in `self.abs_fnames`. The process involves several steps:
1. **Absolute Path Calculation**: The function first computes the absolute path by calling the `abs_root_path` method, which converts the provided relative file name into an absolute one.
2. **Check for Existence**: It then checks whether this computed absolute path exists in the list of absolute file names (`self.abs_fnames`).
3. **Removal and Confirmation**: If the absolute path is found, it removes the entry from `self.abs_fnames` and returns `True`, indicating that the operation was successful.
4. **No Change if Not Found**: If the absolute path does not exist in the list, no changes are made, and the function also returns `False`.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the relative file name provided is valid within the context of the object's root directory to avoid errors.
- The method assumes that the `abs_root_path` method correctly computes the absolute path for the given relative file name.

**Output Example**: If a relative file name "config.txt" exists in `self.abs_fnames`, calling `drop_rel_fname("config.txt")` will remove it and return `True`. If "config.txt" does not exist, the function returns `False`.

### FunctionDef get_cur_message_text(self)
**get_cur_message_text**: The function of get_cur_message_text is to concatenate the contents of all messages currently stored in the Coder's message list into a single string.
**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· self: A reference to the current instance of the Coder class.

**Code Description**: 
The `get_cur_message_text` method iterates through each message in the `cur_messages` attribute of the Coder object. It concatenates the content of each message, appending a newline character after each content string. The resulting text is then returned as a single concatenated string.
This function serves to provide a consolidated view of all current messages, which can be useful for logging or displaying purposes.

**Note**: Ensure that `cur_messages` contains valid dictionaries with "content" keys before calling this method. If any message does not have a "content" key, the corresponding content will simply be an empty string.
This function is called by `get_repo_map`, where it helps in generating a contextually relevant repository map based on the current messages.

**Output Example**: 
If `cur_messages` contains `[{"content": "Hello world"}, {"content": "How are you?"}]`, then `get_cur_message_text()` will return `"Hello world\nHow are you?\n"`.
***
### FunctionDef get_ident_mentions(self, text)
**get_ident_mentions**: The function of get_ident_mentions is to extract unique identifiers mentioned within a given text.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: text (str) - The input text from which identifiers are to be extracted.

**Code Description**: This function processes the provided text by splitting it into individual words using non-alphanumeric characters as delimiters. It then returns a set of these words, ensuring that each identifier is unique.
- **Step 1**: The function starts by importing and utilizing regular expressions (`re` module) to split the input `text`.
- **Step 2**: The text is split into words using the regex pattern `\W+`, which matches one or more non-word characters (equivalent to `[^\w]+`). This effectively removes punctuation and other non-alphanumeric characters, leaving only words.
- **Step 3**: The resulting list of words is converted into a set (`words = set(re.split(r"\W+", text))`), ensuring that each identifier appears only once in the output.

This function plays a crucial role in identifying unique identifiers (like usernames or file names) mentioned within messages, which is essential for context understanding and processing in the coder's workflow. For instance, it helps in tracking mentions of specific files or users across various messages.

**Note**: The function assumes that the input text contains valid identifiers separated by non-alphanumeric characters. If the text contains numbers or special characters that are part of the identifier, these will be preserved as they are split based on non-word boundaries.

**Output Example**: Given the input `text = "user1 mentioned file1.txt and user2 in the same sentence."`, the function would return a set containing `{'user1', 'file1', 'txt', 'user2'}`.
***
### FunctionDef get_ident_filename_matches(self, idents)
**get_ident_filename_matches**: The function of get_ident_filename_matches is to identify filenames that match given identifiers.
**Parameters**:
· idents: A list or set of string identifiers used to find matching filenames.

**Code Description**:
The `get_ident_filename_matches` method in the Coder class is designed to find filenames that correspond to a given set of identifiers. Here’s a detailed analysis:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty dictionary, `all_fnames`, which will store sets of filenames for each identifier.
2. **Collecting Filenames**: It iterates through all relative files obtained by calling the `get_all_relative_files` method. For each filename, it extracts the base name (without the extension) and converts it to lowercase. If the length of the base name is at least 5 characters, it adds the filename to the corresponding set in `all_fnames`.
3. **Matching Identifiers**: The function then iterates through each identifier provided in the `idents` parameter. For identifiers shorter than 5 characters, it skips them.
4. **Finding Matches**: It updates a set called `matches` with all filenames that match any of the identifiers (case-insensitive).
5. **Return Value**: Finally, it returns the `matches` set containing all matching filenames.

This function is crucial for identifying relevant files based on user-provided identifiers, which can be useful in various scenarios such as file search and management within a coding environment.

**Note**:
- The function assumes that the input identifiers are non-empty strings.
- The use of `defaultdict(set)` ensures efficient storage and retrieval of filenames associated with each identifier.
- The length check for identifiers (at least 5 characters) is to prevent unnecessary processing on very short strings, which might be less likely to match actual filenames.

**Output Example**: If the function receives `idents = ["main", "test"]`, it will return a set of filenames from the project that contain these substrings in their base names. For example, if there are files named `main.py`, `test_case.py`, and `example_test.py` in the directory, the output might be `{ 'main.py', 'test_case.py' }`.

- `self.reflected_message` to store the last processed message from a reflection process.
- `self.num_reflections` to count the number of reflections performed.
- `self.lint_outcome` and `self.test_outcome` to record the results of linting and testing operations, respectively.
- An empty list `self.shell_commands` for storing any shell commands generated during the session.

If a repository is associated with the Coder instance (`self.repo`), it appends the SHA hash of the current head commit (shortened or full-length based on the `commit_before_message` attribute) to the `commit_before_message` list. This ensures that any changes made during the session can be linked back to a specific point in the repository.

This method is called by other methods such as `run_stream` and `run_one`, which are responsible for handling user input, processing messages, and managing file operations. By initializing these attributes before running the main logic of the Coder class, it ensures that all necessary data structures and states are properly set up to handle incoming requests.

**Note**: Always ensure that any repository-related operations are performed after `init_before_message` has been called, as this method sets up the initial state required for such operations. Additionally, be aware that if no repository is associated with the Coder instance (`self.repo` is None), the SHA hash retrieval will not occur.

### FunctionDef check_and_open_urls(self, exc, friendly_msg)
**check_and_open_urls**: The function of check_and_open_urls is to process exceptions related to URLs by checking if they are present in an error message and offering to open these URLs in a browser.
**parameters**: 
· exc: Exception object containing the error details from which URLs need to be extracted and processed.
· friendly_msg (optional): A user-friendly message that can be displayed alongside the exception message.

**Code Description**: The function `check_and_open_urls` is designed to handle exceptions related to URL extraction. It first converts the exception object into a string representation (`text`). If a `friendly_msg` parameter is provided, it issues warnings and errors using the coder's input/output interface (io). Otherwise, it only logs an error message.

The function then uses a regular expression to find all URLs in the error message text. Duplicates are removed by converting the list of URLs into a set and back into a list. For each unique URL found, the function strips any trailing punctuation and offers the URL for opening in the browser using the coder's input/output interface.

The primary purpose of this function is to provide developers with an easy way to inspect or access problematic URLs directly from error messages, enhancing debugging efficiency.
**Note**: Ensure that the regular expression pattern used to find URLs accurately captures a wide variety of URL formats. Also, be cautious when handling exceptions as it might impact the flow of the program execution.

**Output Example**: 
Given an exception with text "Failed to connect: https://example.com and http://test.org", the function would output:
- A warning or error message about the URLs.
- The URLs https://example.com and http://test.org are offered for opening in a browser.

***
### FunctionDef keyboard_interrupt(self)
**keyboard_interrupt**: The function of `keyboard_interrupt` is to handle repeated keyboard interrupts during the execution of the program.
**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `keyboard_interrupt` method checks if a KeyboardInterrupt has been raised recently within a certain threshold time (2 seconds in this case). If another interrupt occurs within this time frame, it logs a warning message and exits the program. Otherwise, it logs an additional warning message indicating that pressing Ctrl+C again will result in exiting the program.

The function first records the current time using `time.time()`. It then checks if there was a previous keyboard interrupt (`self.last_keyboard_interrupt`) within the defined threshold of 2 seconds. If so, it outputs a warning message via the `io` object indicating that pressing Ctrl+C again will cause the program to exit and subsequently terminates the program with `sys.exit()`.

If no recent keyboard interrupt is detected, it logs another warning message suggesting the user press Ctrl+C once more to exit the program before updating the last interrupt time (`self.last_keyboard_interrupt`) to the current time.

This method ensures that if a user accidentally presses Ctrl+C, they have one additional opportunity to confirm their intention by pressing it again. This enhances usability and prevents accidental exits from the program due to single unintentional keyboard interrupts.

**Note**: Developers should ensure that the `io` object is properly configured to handle logging messages appropriately. The threshold time of 2 seconds can be adjusted based on specific requirements, but it must be balanced between user experience and program stability.

### FunctionDef summarize_end(self)
**summarize_end**: The function of summarize_end is to ensure that any summarization thread is properly joined before resetting related attributes.
**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `summarize_end` method ensures the proper handling and cleaning up of a summarization process. It first checks if there is an active summarizer thread (`self.summarizer_thread`). If such a thread exists, it waits for the thread to complete by calling `join()`, effectively stopping any ongoing summarization task. After joining, the thread object is set to None to indicate that no new summarization tasks will be initiated via this thread.

Following this, the method updates two attributes: 
1. It sets `self.done_messages` to contain the current value of `self.summarized_done_messages`, which likely holds a list of messages or information that have been summarized.
2. It resets `self.summarized_done_messages` to an empty list, preparing it for potential future use.

This function is crucial in ensuring that all threads are properly managed and resources are cleaned up before moving on to the next task or phase of operation. Its relationship with other methods such as `summarize_start` and `format_chat_chunks` ensures a coherent workflow where summarization tasks are initiated, completed, and then reset for the next phase.

**Note**: Ensure that any thread operations are handled correctly to avoid deadlock situations. Always check if a thread is running before attempting to join it to prevent unnecessary blocking or errors.
**Output Example**: The function does not return any value; its primary output is modifying internal state attributes (`self.done_messages` and `self.summarized_done_messages`).

### FunctionDef move_back_cur_messages(self, message)
### Object: UserAuthentication

#### Overview
The `UserAuthentication` object is designed to handle user authentication processes within the application. It ensures secure and efficient verification of user credentials, providing essential security measures such as password hashing and session management.

#### Properties
- **userId**: A unique identifier for each user.
- **userName**: The username or email address used by the user during login.
- **passwordHash**: The hashed version of the user's password stored securely.
- **sessionToken**: A unique token generated upon successful authentication, used to maintain a session between the user and the application.
- **lastLoginTime**: Timestamp indicating when the user last logged in.

#### Methods
1. **authenticateUser**
   - **Description**: Verifies the provided username and password against stored credentials.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `username`: The user's username or email address.
     - `password`: The plain-text password entered by the user.
   - **Returns**: 
     - `true` if authentication is successful, `false` otherwise.
   - **Example Usage**:
     ```python
     result = UserAuthentication.authenticateUser("john.doe@example.com", "securePassword123")
     ```

2. **generateSessionToken**
   - **Description**: Creates a unique session token for the authenticated user.
   - **Parameters**: None.
   - **Returns**: A randomly generated session token.
   - **Example Usage**:
     ```python
     session_token = UserAuthentication.generateSessionToken()
     ```

3. **updateLastLoginTime**
   - **Description**: Updates the last login time for the authenticated user.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `userId`: The unique identifier of the user.
   - **Returns**: None.
   - **Example Usage**:
     ```python
     UserAuthentication.updateLastLoginTime("12345")
     ```

#### Security Considerations
- Passwords are stored as hashed values using a secure hashing algorithm to protect sensitive data.
- Session tokens are generated with sufficient entropy to prevent guessing and replay attacks.
- Regular updates and patches should be applied to the authentication module to address any potential vulnerabilities.

#### Best Practices
- Always validate user input before processing it.
- Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on login attempts.
- Use HTTPS for secure transmission of sensitive data over the network.

#### Example Scenario
A user logs in with their credentials. The `authenticateUser` method is called, which checks the provided username and password against stored hashes. If successful, a session token is generated using `generateSessionToken`, and the `updateLastLoginTime` method updates the last login time for that user.

By following these guidelines, the `UserAuthentication` object ensures robust and secure authentication processes within the application.
***
### FunctionDef get_user_language(self)
**get_user_language**: The function of get_user_language is to determine and return the user's language preference.
**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `get_user_language` function is designed to identify the user's preferred language based on several sources, prioritizing specific order. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Priority 1: Chat Language**: The function first checks if there is an existing value stored in `self.chat_language`. If this property exists and has a non-null value, it returns that value immediately.

2. **Priority 2: Locale Settings**: Next, the function attempts to retrieve the user's language settings using `locale.getlocale()[0]`. This method provides the full language code (e.g., "en_US"), which includes both the language and country codes. If this call succeeds and returns a non-empty string, it is returned.

3. **Priority 3: Environment Variables**: The function then checks a list of common environment variables that might contain the user's language settings:
   - `LANG`
   - `LANGUAGE`
   - `LC_ALL`
   - `LC_MESSAGES`

   For each variable in this list, if an environment variable is found and contains a non-empty value, it splits the string at the first period (`.`) to get the language code (e.g., "en_US" becomes "en"). This step ensures that any encoding information present after the first dot is discarded.

4. **Fallback**: If none of the above methods yield a valid result, the function returns `None`.

This function plays a crucial role in determining the user's preferred language for better localization and user experience across different platforms and environments. It is called by the `get_platform_info` method to include this information in platform-related details.

**Note**: The function handles exceptions gracefully when retrieving locale settings from the environment, ensuring that any errors do not disrupt the overall process of determining the user's language preference.

**Output Example**: 
- If `self.chat_language` is set to "en_US", the function will return "en_US".
- If no chat language is set and the system locale is "fr_FR.UTF-8", it would return "fr_FR".
- If neither of these are available, but the environment variable `LANG` has a value like "de_DE.utf8", it would return "de_DE".
***
### FunctionDef get_platform_info(self)
**get_platform_info**: The function of get_platform_info is to gather and return information about the current platform's environment.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The `get_platform_info` method collects various pieces of information related to the user's development environment, which are then formatted into a string. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Platform Information**: 
   - The function starts by determining the platform using `platform.platform()`, which returns a string identifying the underlying system (e.g., "Windows-10-10.0.19042"). This is added to the output text with a label "- Platform: ".

2. **Shell Information**: 
   - The shell used by the user is determined based on the operating system. For Windows (`os.name == 'nt'`), `COMSPEC` environment variable is used; for other systems, `SHELL` is used. This information, along with its value if present, is added to the output text as "- Shell: COMSPEC=...".

3. **User Language**: 
   - The user's preferred language is obtained by calling `self.get_user_language()`. If a valid language code is returned, it is appended to the output string as "- Language: [language_code]\n". This function checks various sources such as chat language settings, system locale, and environment variables.

4. **Current Date**: 
   - The current date in ISO format (e.g., "2023-10-05") is added to the output string with a label "- Current Date: ". 

5. **Additional Shell Command Information**: 
   - If `suggest_shell_commands` is enabled, additional prompts and reminders related to shell commands are included based on the platform information.

6. **Formatting**: 
   - The collected information is formatted into a single string using placeholders like `{platform}`, `{shell_cmd_prompt}`, etc., which are later replaced with actual values when the prompt is generated in `fmt_system_prompt`.

**Note**: The function assumes that other methods such as `get_user_language` and properties like `suggest_shell_commands`, `fence`, `gpt_prompts`, and `main_model.lazy` are properly defined elsewhere in the codebase.

**Output Example**: A possible return value could be:
```
- Platform: Windows-10-10.0.19042
- Shell: COMSPEC=C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe
- Language: en-US
- Current Date: 2023-10-05
```

### FunctionDef warm_cache(self, chunks)
**warm_cache**: The function of `warm_cache` is to initiate cache warming by sending predefined message chunks to the model.
**parameters**:
· `chunks`: A collection of message chunks that are used to warm up the cache.

**Code Description**: 
The `warm_cache` method is designed to pre-warm the cache for a language model. It performs this task only if certain conditions are met, such as the presence of cache warming headers and the availability of cache warming pings. If these conditions are not satisfied, it does nothing.

1. **Condition Check**: The function first checks whether there are any cache warming headers present in the request. This is done using `self.headers.get("X-Model-Cache-Warm")`. If no such header exists, the method returns without performing any actions.
2. **Cache Warming Pings**: It then verifies if there are enough cache warming pings available by checking `self.num_cache_warm_pings` against a threshold value (10 in this case). If not enough pings are available, it also exits early.
3. **Message Sending**: Assuming the above conditions are met, the method proceeds to send predefined message chunks (`chunks`) to the model. This is achieved by iterating through each chunk and calling `self.send_message(chunk)`.

The purpose of cache warming is to ensure that frequently accessed data or responses are readily available in memory, thereby improving performance during actual usage scenarios.

**Note**: The method does not return any value explicitly but modifies the state of the object by sending messages. It also updates internal counters such as `self.num_cache_warm_pings` and potentially logs actions for monitoring purposes.

**Output Example**: 
The output is primarily a change in state, with no explicit return value. However, you might observe an increase in the `num_cache_warm_pings` counter if the method successfully sends all predefined message chunks. Additionally, logging or internal metrics might indicate that cache warming has been initiated.
#### FunctionDef warm_cache_worker
**warm_cache_worker**: The function of warm_cache_worker is to periodically send requests to the main model to warm up the cache.
**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The `warm_cache_worker` function operates as an infinite loop, designed to periodically send requests to the main model in order to keep its cache warm. The function ensures that these requests are sent at regular intervals by checking the current time and a predefined next warm-up timestamp (`self.next_cache_warm`). Here is a detailed breakdown of how it works:

1. **Infinite Loop**: The `while True` loop ensures that the function runs continuously, making periodic cache warming requests.
2. **Time Delay**: The function uses `time.sleep(1)` to introduce a one-second delay between each iteration of the loop. This helps in managing system resources by preventing excessive CPU usage.
3. **Check for Remaining Requests**: The condition `if self.warming_pings_left <= 0:` ensures that if there are no remaining cache warming requests allowed, the function skips this cycle and continues to the next one. This is useful for rate limiting or when a certain number of warm-up requests have already been made.
4. **Time Check**: If the current time `now` is before the scheduled next warm-up timestamp (`self.next_cache_warm`), the loop continues without sending any request, effectively waiting until the next cycle.
5. **Decrement Requests and Schedule Next Warm-Up**: Once it's time to send a cache warming request, the function decrements the remaining requests by `1` using `self.warming_pings_left -= 1`. It then calculates the new `next_cache_warm` timestamp by adding a delay (presumably defined elsewhere) to the current time.
6. **Construct Request Parameters**: The function constructs the parameters for the cache warming request, including setting up the content as a list containing an empty string and passing it along with other necessary information like the API key or model identifier.
7. **Send Request**: Using the `send` method of the `self.main_model` object, the function sends the constructed request to the main model. The response is logged using `logger.info`, providing insights into the cache warming process.

The relationship between `warm_cache_worker` and its callees in the project:
- It interacts with the `main_model` object's `send` method to send cache warming requests.
- It relies on the `all_messages` method from the `cacheable_messages` function, which provides a list of messages that might be used for constructing request content if needed.

**Note**: 
- The function assumes that the `warming_pings_left` and `next_cache_warm` attributes are correctly initialized before it starts running.
- Ensure that the delay between cache warming requests is appropriately set to avoid overwhelming the system or violating any rate limits imposed by the API.

        """
        Returns the current list of unresolved customer inquiries.

        :return: A list of strings representing unresolved inquiries.
        """
        return self.inquiries

    def get_resolved_issues(self) -> list[str]:
        """
        Returns the current list of resolved customer issues.

        :return: A list of strings representing resolved issues.
        """
        return self.resolved_issues
```

#### Usage Examples

```python
# Initialize CustomerService instance
customer_service = CustomerService()

# Add a new inquiry
customer_service.add_inquiry("I am having trouble logging into my account.")
print(customer_service.get_inquiries())  # Output: ['I am having trouble logging into my account.']

# Resolve an issue by index
if customer_service.resolve_issue(0):
    print("Issue resolved successfully!")
else:
    print("Failed to resolve the issue.")

# Get unresolved and resolved inquiries
unresolved = customer_service.get_inquiries()
resolved = customer_service.get_resolved_issues()

print(f"Unresolved Inquiries: {unresolved}")
print(f"Resolved Issues: {resolved}")
```

#### Detailed Explanation

- **Initialization**: The `__init__` method initializes the `CustomerService` object with two lists, `inquiries` and `resolved_issues`, to keep track of customer inquiries and resolved issues.
  
- **Adding Inquiries**: The `add_inquiry` method allows adding new customer inquiries to the `inquiries` list. It takes a single string parameter representing the inquiry.

- **Resolving Issues**: The `resolve_issue` method attempts to resolve an existing inquiry by its index in the `inquiries` list and moves it to the `resolved_issues` list. If the provided index is out of range, it returns `False`.

- **Retrieving Inquiries**: The `get_inquiries` method returns a list of all current unresolved customer inquiries.

- **Retrieving Resolved Issues**: The `get_resolved_issues` method returns a list of all resolved customer issues.

#### Notes

- Ensure that the index provided to `resolve_issue` is within the valid range to avoid errors.
- This class can be extended with additional methods for more complex operations, such as categorizing inquiries or tracking resolution times.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters as it is an instance method of the Coder class.
**Code Description**: The `reply_completed` function is called within the `send_message` method after all messages have been sent and processed. Its primary purpose is to handle the completion actions necessary for the response, such as updating the usage report, checking if the context window was exhausted, managing partial responses, and applying any updates or edits made during the interaction.

1. **Usage Report**: The function first checks and potentially displays a usage report using `self.show_usage_report()`. This step is crucial for tracking the resource utilization of the AI model.
2. **Exhausted Context Window Handling**: If the context window was exhausted (`exhausted` flag set to True), an error message is displayed, and the function increments the count of exhausted context windows (`self.num_exhausted_context_windows += 1`). This helps in monitoring and managing the number of times the context limit is reached.
3. **Partial Response Management**: The function checks for any partial response content or function calls that need to be handled. It retrieves arguments from a potential partial call using `self.parse_partial_args()` and sets the appropriate content based on these arguments.
4. **Message Updates and Commits**: If there are edited messages (`edited` flag set), the function commits these changes to the repository, ensuring that any modifications made during the interaction are saved. It also updates the current messages with the new content using `self.update_cur_messages()`.
5. **Linting and Testing**: The function checks for linting errors if auto-lint is enabled (`self.auto_lint`). If there are linting issues, it offers an option to fix them automatically. Similarly, it runs tests on any edited files if auto-testing is enabled.
6. **Shell Commands Execution**: It executes shell commands related to the interaction and adds the output of these commands as a message in the current messages list.
7. **File Mention Handling**: The function checks for mentions of relevant files in the response content (`self.check_for_file_mentions(content)`), which helps in updating the context with any referenced files.

The `reply_completed` method is called after the main message sending logic and ensures that all necessary post-processing steps are completed, making sure the interaction is fully managed and documented.

**Note**: Ensure that the `reply_completed` function is called appropriately within the `send_message` method to maintain the proper flow of the conversation. Any changes or edits made during the interaction should be properly handled before finalizing the response.

### FunctionDef update_cur_messages(self)
**update_cur_messages**: The function of update_cur_messages is to append new messages to the current list of messages based on the presence of assistant responses or function calls.
**Parameters**: 
· self: The instance of the Coder class, which provides access to internal state and methods.

**Code Description**: This function updates the `cur_messages` attribute by appending new entries when there are either partial assistant responses or function calls. Specifically:

- If a `partial_response_content` exists (indicating an incomplete response from the model), it appends a dictionary representing an "assistant" role with the content of this partial response.
- Similarly, if a `partial_response_function_call` is present, it appends another dictionary to represent the assistant's function call, setting the content to `None` and including the details of the function call.

This method ensures that all interactions between the user input and model responses are recorded in a structured format within the `cur_messages` list. This list can then be used for various purposes such as displaying chat history, logging interactions, or further processing.

**Note**: The function is called at the end of the `send_message` method after handling different types of responses from the model. It ensures that any partial content or function calls made during the interaction are properly recorded and updated in the message log. This helps maintain a coherent record of all communications between the user and the AI, which can be crucial for debugging, auditing, or providing context to users about their interactions with the system.

### FunctionDef render_incremental_response(self, final)
**render_incremental_response**: The function of `render_incremental_response` is to generate an incremental response string based on whether the final content has been received.

**Parameters**:
· parameter1: `final (bool)`
    - Indicates whether this is the final rendering call or a partial one. If `True`, it means the complete response is available and should be rendered fully; if `False`, it indicates an intermediate state where only part of the response content should be rendered.

**Code Description**: 
The function `render_incremental_response` is responsible for generating and returning the appropriate response content based on whether the final version has been received. It does this by concatenating the current multi-response content with any new partial response content that might have accumulated during the process of receiving an incremental response from a language model.

1. **Initialization**: The function starts by initializing `cur` to the existing multi-response content or an empty string if none is available, and `new` to the partial response content or an empty string if none exists.
2. **Conditional Trimming**: If the new content does not end with whitespace (i.e., it has been trimmed), and this is not a final call (`final=False`), then any trailing whitespace in `new` is removed using `rstrip()`. This ensures that only meaningful text is appended to the current response.
3. **Concatenation**: The function concatenates the current multi-response content with the trimmed new content (if applicable) and returns this combined string.

This function is crucial for handling incremental responses from a language model, where the full response might be received in parts over time. It ensures that partial responses are displayed correctly until the final version is available.

**Note**: The function `render_incremental_response` is called by two other functions within the project: `show_send_output` and `live_incremental_response`. In both these contexts, it helps manage the display of incremental responses in a way that respects their current state (partial or complete).

- **Caller 1 - show_send_output**: This function uses `render_incremental_response(True)` to ensure that when the final response is received, it is fully displayed. If there are any errors during this process, such as missing tool calls or content, these are reported via an error message.
  
- **Caller 2 - live_incremental_response**: In contrast, `live_incremental_response` uses `render_incremental_response(final)` with `final` set to a boolean value that indicates whether the response is complete. This allows it to update the display in real-time as new parts of the response become available.

**Output Example**: 
If called with `final=True`, and assuming the current multi-response content is "Hello, " and the partial response content is "world!", the function might return "Hello, world!". If called with `final=False` during an intermediate state, it might only return "Hello, " if no new data has been received since the last call.

#### FunctionDef format_cost(value)
**format_cost**: The function of format_cost is to convert a numerical value into a formatted string representation, particularly useful for displaying cost values.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: value (float or int) - The numerical value representing the cost that needs to be formatted.

**Code Description**:
The `format_cost` function takes a single argument `value`, which is expected to be a numeric type such as float or integer. This function's primary goal is to return a string representation of this value in a user-friendly format, especially when dealing with monetary values. Here’s how the function achieves its purpose:

1. **Checking for Zero Value**: The first condition checks if `value` equals zero. If true, it directly returns the string `"0.00"`. This ensures that any cost equal to zero is consistently represented as "0.00".

2. **Handling Values Greater Than or Equal to 0.01**: For values greater than or equal to 0.01 (i.e., `magnitude >= 0.01`), the function uses string formatting with two decimal places (`"{value:.2f}"`). This ensures that costs larger than a penny are displayed with standard currency formatting.

3. **Handling Values Less Than 0.01**: For values smaller than 0.01, the function employs more sophisticated formatting to handle very small numbers effectively:
   - It calculates the `magnitude` of the value using `abs(value)` to ensure it works correctly for both positive and negative numbers.
   - The condition checks if `magnitude < 0.01`. If true, it determines the number of decimal places needed by calculating the integer part of the logarithm base 10 of the magnitude (`int(math.log10(magnitude))`).
   - It then uses this calculation to set the precision in the string format. The formula `max(2, 2 - int(math.log10(magnitude)))` ensures that at least two decimal places are used but reduces them as the value approaches zero.

This approach provides a balanced and readable representation of cost values across different magnitudes, ensuring clarity for users regardless of whether the costs are large or very small.

**Note**: 
- The function assumes that `value` is always a numeric type. If non-numeric types are passed, it may raise a `TypeError`.
- The use of logarithms in determining decimal places might be less efficient for extremely small values but ensures precision at smaller scales.
- Consider the context where this function will be used to ensure consistent formatting across different outputs.

**Output Example**: 
- Input: `format_cost(15.99)` returns `"15.99"`.
- Input: `format_cost(0.0078)` returns `"0.0078"`.
- Input: `format_cost(0)` returns `"0.00"`.

***
### FunctionDef show_usage_report(self)
**show_usage_report**: The function of show_usage_report is to output usage statistics and trigger an event.
**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `show_usage_report` method first checks if there is an existing usage report stored in the instance (`self.usage_report`). If no report exists, it simply returns without further action. Otherwise, it proceeds to output this report using the `io.tool_output` method.

Next, the function calculates the number of prompt tokens and completion tokens sent and received during the current interaction session. These values are then used as parameters in an event called via `self.event`. This event is designed to track various aspects of message interactions, including the total token count and associated costs.

After collecting and logging these statistics, the method resets several counters related to the current interaction: `self.message_cost` (reset to 0.0), `self.message_tokens_sent` (reset to 0), and `self.message_tokens_received` (reset to 0). This ensures that subsequent interactions start with fresh counts.

This function is called at the end of a message sending process, likely after handling potential errors or interruptions during communication with an AI model. It helps in maintaining accurate records of usage for billing purposes or performance monitoring.
**Note**: Ensure that `self.io` and `self.usage_report` are properly initialized before calling this method to avoid runtime errors. The `self.event` call ensures that relevant usage data is logged, which can be crucial for tracking the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of interactions with AI models.
**Output Example**: 
The output will depend on what `self.io.tool_output` prints, but it typically includes a summary of token counts and costs associated with the interaction. For example:
```
Prompt Tokens: 1024
Completion Tokens: 512
Total Cost: $0.03
```

### FunctionDef is_file_safe(self, fname)
**is_file_safe**: The function of `is_file_safe` is to check if a given file path exists.
**Parameters**:
· fname: The file path to be checked.

**Code Description**: 
The `is_file_safe` method checks whether the specified file path exists by utilizing the `Path` object from Python's standard library. It first constructs an absolute path using the provided file name and the root directory obtained through the `abs_root_path` method (which is not shown but assumed to be part of the same class). The constructed path is then checked for its existence using the `is_file()` method, which returns a boolean value indicating whether the path points to an existing regular file. If an `OSError` occurs during this process (e.g., due to incorrect permissions or invalid paths), the function catches the exception and returns without any value.

This method ensures that the application can safely handle file operations by verifying the existence of files before attempting to perform actions on them, thereby preventing potential errors such as trying to read a non-existent file. The `abs_root_path` method is called to ensure that the path used for checking is absolute and correctly formatted, which helps in maintaining consistency across different environments.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the provided `fname` parameter is valid and points to an expected location within the application's directory structure.
- The function does not return any value if an error occurs during path construction or file existence check. This could indicate a critical issue with the path, so it should be handled appropriately in the calling code.

**Output Example**: 
```python
# Assuming 'self.abs_root_path_cache' contains valid mappings and 'Path' is correctly imported from Python's `pathlib` module.
result = Coder.is_file_safe("test.txt")
print(result)  # Output could be True if "test.txt" exists, or None if an error occurs.

result = Coder.is_file_safe("nonexistent.txt")
print(result)  # Output will be None due to OSError.
```

### FunctionDef check_for_dirty_commit(self, path)
**check_for_dirty_commit**: The function of `check_for_dirty_commit` is to ensure that a specified file or directory has not been modified since its last commit before applying any edits.
· parameter1: `path`: A string representing the file or directory path relative to the root of the Git repository.

**Code Description**: 
The `check_for_dirty_commit` method first checks if the `repo` attribute is available. If it is not, the function returns early without performing further operations. Next, it verifies whether there are any dirty commits in the current session using the `self.dirty_commits` attribute. If no dirty commits exist, the function also returns early.

If both conditions pass, the method uses the `repo.is_dirty(path)` method to check if the specified path is dirty (i.e., modified since the last commit). If the path is not dirty, the function again returns early.

The code then proceeds with an additional check that was commented out but could be used to ensure that committed versions of files are available before making changes. This step would involve checking the file's size and skipping further operations if the file is empty.

Finally, if all checks pass, a tool output message is generated indicating that the specified path needs to be committed before applying edits. The path is then added to the `need_commit_before_edits` set, which likely tracks files requiring commit before editing.

**Note**: Ensure that the Git repository object (`self.repo`) is properly initialized and available within the class context for accurate results. Also, note that if no path is provided or if it does not exist in the tracked files, `True` will be returned, indicating an untracked or non-existent file.

This function plays a crucial role in ensuring data integrity by preventing edits to modified files before they are committed. It integrates with other methods like `allowed_to_edit`, which also check for file modifications and handle the creation of new files if necessary.

**Output Example**: 
- If the path "src/main.py" exists in the repository but has been modified since its last commit: `check_for_dirty_commit("src/main.py")` will generate a tool output message indicating that the file needs to be committed before applying edits, and it adds "src/main.py" to the `need_commit_before_edits` set.
- If the path "src/old_code.py" does not exist in the tracked files: `check_for_dirty_commit("src/old_code.py")` will also generate a tool output message indicating that the file needs to be committed before applying edits, and it adds "src/old_code.py" to the `need_commit_before_edits` set.

### FunctionDef get_context_from_history(self, history)
**get_context_from_history**: The function of get_context_from_history is to construct a context string from a history of messages.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: history - A list of message dictionaries containing "role" and "content" keys.

**Code Description**: 
The `get_context_from_history` method takes in a `history` parameter, which should be a list of message dictionaries. Each dictionary is expected to have at least two keys: `"role"` and `"content"`. The function iterates through each message in the history, appending formatted strings to the `context` variable. Specifically, it concatenates the role (converted to uppercase) followed by a colon and a space, then the content of the message, with each new message starting on a new line.

If the `history` is empty or `None`, no context will be added to the `context` string. The final constructed context string is then returned.

This function plays a crucial role in providing contextual information for commits or other operations that require historical context from previous messages. In the project, it is called by the `auto_commit` method of the `Coder` class to gather relevant history before performing an automated commit operation.

**Note**: Ensure that each message dictionary in the `history` list contains both `"role"` and `"content"` keys to avoid runtime errors or unexpected behavior.

**Output Example**: If the `history` parameter is `[{"role": "user", "content": "Can you help me with this code?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure, what's the issue?"}]`, then the output of `get_context_from_history(history)` would be:
```
USER: Can you help me with this code?
ASSISTANT: Sure, what's the issue?
```

    print(f"User {user.username} authenticated successfully.")
else:
    print("Invalid username or password.")

# Change the user's password
success = user.change_password('securepassword123', 'newsecurepassword456')
if success:
    print("Password changed successfully.")
else:
    print("Failed to change password.")

# Deactivate and reactivate the account
user.deactivate_account()
print(f"Account deactivated: {user.is_active}")

user.reactivate_account()
print(f"Account reactivated: {user.is_active}")
```

**Security Considerations**
- Ensure that passwords are always hashed before storage.
- Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
- Use secure connections (HTTPS) when transmitting sensitive information.

This documentation provides a comprehensive understanding of the `UserAuthentication` object, its properties, methods, and usage scenarios.

### FunctionDef show_auto_commit_outcome(self, res)
**show_auto_commit_outcome**: The function of `show_auto_commit_outcome` is to process the outcome of an automatic commit operation by updating internal state variables.

**Parameters**: 
· parameter1: res (The result of the auto-commit operation, expected to be a tuple containing the commit hash and commit message.)

**Code Description**: 

This method handles the output from an automatic commit operation. It takes the result `res`, which is expected to be a tuple consisting of the commit hash and commit message generated by the commit process.

1. **Commit Hash Update**: The first step involves extracting the commit hash from the `res` tuple and assigning it to `self.last_aider_commit_hash`. This variable keeps track of the most recent commit made by the coder.
2. **Commit Message Update**: Similarly, the commit message is extracted and assigned to `self.last_aider_commit_message`, updating the record of the last commit's message.
3. **Adding Commit Hash**: The commit hash is added to `self.aider_commit_hashes` set, which stores a history of all commits made by the coder during their sessions.

4. **Displaying Differences (Optional)**: If `self.show_diffs` is set to True, it indicates that the coder has requested to view differences between the current and previous commit messages. In this case, the method calls `self.commands.cmd_diff()` to display these changes using a diff tool. This functionality requires that the coder's environment supports Git operations.

**Note**: The method relies on having an active repository (`self.repo`), proper configuration of the coder object (including the `io` interface for output and `show_diffs` setting), and a valid result from the auto-commit operation to function correctly. Any changes made to files or commit history should be reflected in the repository state before calling this method, as it directly references these internal states. Additionally, ensure that the `cmd_diff` method is properly configured and available for execution when differences are requested.
***
### FunctionDef show_undo_hint(self)
**show_undo_hint**: The function of show_undo_hint is to display a hint about undo functionality if certain conditions are met.

**Code Description**: 
The `show_undo_hint` method checks whether there was a commit before the current message being processed. If no such commit exists, it returns immediately without performing any further actions. Otherwise, it compares the last commit in `self.commit_before_message` with the current head commit of the Git repository using `get_head_commit_sha`. If these two commits are not identical, it indicates that a new commit has been made since the message was created or modified. In this case, the method outputs a hint to the user suggesting they can use `/undo` to undo and discard recent changes.

The method relies on several components:
- `self.commit_before_message`: A list or similar structure containing information about previous commits or messages.
- `self.io.tool_output()`: A method for outputting tool-related messages to the user interface.
- `self.repo.get_head_commit_sha(short=False)`: A call to retrieve the SHA hash of the current head commit from the Git repository.

**Note**: Always ensure that `get_head_commit_sha()` returns a valid commit before using its result, as it may return `None` if no valid head commit is found. This function helps maintain consistency and provides useful feedback to users about their undo options.

**Output Example**: The method does not return any value but outputs a message to the user interface tool if conditions are met. Here’s an example of how it might look:
```
You can use /undo to undo and discard each aider commit.
```

### FunctionDef get_edits(self, mode)
**get_edits**: The function of get_edits is to return an empty list.
**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: mode (default value: "update")
**Code Description**: 
The `get_edits` method returns an empty list regardless of the input mode. This method does not perform any operations or checks and always returns an empty list, which is then used in other methods such as `apply_updates`.

In the context of its caller, `apply_updates`, the purpose of `get_edits` is to provide a starting point for edits that need to be applied. The `apply_updates` method uses `get_edits()` to gather any necessary edits before proceeding with further processing steps like applying these edits (both dry run and actual application), handling errors, and providing feedback.

The relationship between `get_edits` and its caller `apply_updates` is clear: `apply_updates` relies on the result of `get_edits` as a prerequisite to determine what actions need to be taken. Since `get_edits` always returns an empty list in this implementation, it implies that there are no edits available or required by default.

**Note**: 
- The method's behavior is consistent regardless of the mode parameter, which might seem redundant given its current implementation.
- Ensure that other parts of the codebase do not rely on a non-empty return value from `get_edits` if this function is expected to provide different results in future implementations.

**Output Example**: 
The output of `get_edits()` will always be an empty list: `[]`.
***
### FunctionDef apply_edits(self, edits)
**apply_edits**: The function of apply_edits is to apply a set of edits to the current state.
**parameters**:
· edits: A set of edits to be applied.

**Code Description**: 
The `apply_edits` method is responsible for applying a set of edits to the current state. This method is called within the context of another method, `apply_updates`, which handles various steps in the process of editing and updating files. The `apply_edits` function takes a single parameter, `edits`, which is expected to be a set containing the details of the edits to be applied.

The `apply_edits` function itself does not perform any operations; instead, it relies on other methods or external logic to actually apply the edits. This design pattern allows for flexibility in how the edits are processed and ensures that `apply_edits` remains focused on its core responsibility—applying the edits.

From a functional perspective, this method is called within the broader context of updating files based on edits provided by an LLM (Language Model). The `apply_updates` method orchestrates several steps:
1. Retrieving edits from some source.
2. Performing a dry run to validate the edits.
3. Preparing the edits for application.
4. Applying the actual edits.

The `apply_edits` function is part of this process, specifically handling step 4. It does not return any value but instead updates the state based on the provided edits. If an error occurs during the edit application, it catches exceptions and handles them appropriately, logging errors or providing feedback to the user.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `edits` parameter is a set containing valid edit details before calling this method.
- The `apply_edits` function should be called only after all necessary pre-processing steps have been completed.

**Output Example**: Since `apply_edits` does not return any value, it will not produce an output. However, if the edits are applied in a dry-run mode and the `dry_run` flag is set to `True`, the method might print messages indicating that no changes were made due to the dry run. If `dry_run` is `False`, it may log messages confirming the application of each edit or handle any exceptions as described in the exception handling block within `apply_updates`.
***
### FunctionDef apply_edits_dry_run(self, edits)
**apply_edits_dry_run**: The function of apply_edits_dry_run is to return the edits without applying them.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: edits (list or set) - A collection of edits that need to be processed.

**Code Description**: This function plays a crucial role in simulating changes before they are actually applied. It takes a list or set of edits as input and returns the same exact edits without making any modifications to the underlying system. The purpose is to check if the provided edits are valid or conform to the expected format, all within a "dry run" context where no actual changes are made.

In the broader context of the `apply_updates` function (which calls this one), apply_edits_dry_run acts as a preliminary step to validate and prepare the edits. If any issues arise during the dry run, they can be caught early on, preventing potential errors when attempting to apply the edits for real. This ensures that only valid and correctly formatted edits proceed to the actual application phase.

The `apply_updates` function handles various exceptions, including malformed responses from the LLM (Language Model) or git-related issues. If an error occurs during the dry run, it will be caught by `apply_updates`, which then outputs an appropriate message and returns a set of paths that were intended to be edited but were not due to the error.

**Note**: 
- The function is designed for use in a "dry run" scenario where no actual changes should occur. It is crucial to ensure that all edits are correctly formatted before proceeding with their application.
- If an exception occurs during the dry run, it will be caught and handled by `apply_updates`, which may output error messages or other relevant information.

**Output Example**: 
```python
edits = [("/path/to/file1", "line1"), ("/path/to/file2", "line2")]
result = apply_edits_dry_run(edits)
print(result)  # Output: ["/path/to/file1", "/path/to/file2"]
```
In this example, the function returns a list of paths that would have been edited, but no actual changes are made.

db_connector = DatabaseConnector(config)
if db_connector.connect():
    print("Database connection established.")
else:
    print("Failed to establish database connection.")
```

### Executing a Query

```python
query = "SELECT * FROM users;"
result = db_connector.execute_query(query)
if result is not None:
    for row in result:
        print(row)
else:
    print("Query execution failed.")
```

### Executing a Transaction

```python
queries = [
    "UPDATE users SET balance = 100 WHERE id = 1",
    "INSERT INTO transactions (user_id, amount) VALUES (1, 50)"
]

if db_connector.execute_transaction(queries):
    print("Transaction executed successfully.")
else:
    print("Transaction failed.")
```

### Closing the Connection

```python
db_connector.close()
print("Database connection closed.")
```

## Notes

- Ensure that the `establish_connection` function is defined elsewhere in your codebase.
- Handle exceptions and errors appropriately to maintain application stability.
- Use secure methods for handling sensitive information like passwords.

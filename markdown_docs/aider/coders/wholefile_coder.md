# Connect to the database
if db_manager.connect():
    print("Database connected successfully.")
    
    # Execute a query
    results = db_manager.execute_query("SELECT * FROM users")
    for row in results:
        print(row)
    
    # Commit a transaction
    queries = [
        "UPDATE users SET balance = 100 WHERE id = 1",
        "INSERT INTO transactions (user_id, amount) VALUES (1, 50)"
    ]
    if db_manager.execute_transaction(queries):
        print("Transaction committed successfully.")
    
    # Close the connection
    db_manager.close_connection()
else:
    print("Failed to connect to the database.")

### FunctionDef get_edits(self, mode)
### Object: UserAuthenticationService

#### Overview
The `UserAuthenticationService` is a critical component of the application responsible for managing user authentication processes. It ensures secure and efficient access control by verifying user credentials against a predefined database or external service.

#### Responsibilities
- **User Authentication**: Validates user login credentials (username/password) to ensure they are authorized to access the system.
- **Session Management**: Manages user sessions, including session creation, renewal, and termination.
- **Security**: Implements security measures such as encryption for sensitive data and secure communication protocols to protect against unauthorized access.

#### Key Methods

1. **AuthenticateUser**
   - **Description**: Validates a user's credentials (username and password) against the authentication database.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `username`: The username provided by the user.
     - `password`: The password provided by the user, which should be encrypted before being passed to this method.
   - **Return Value**: A boolean indicating whether the authentication was successful (`true`) or not (`false`).
   - **Example Usage**:
     ```java
     boolean isValidUser = UserAuthenticationService.authenticateUser("john_doe", "secure_password");
     ```

2. **CreateSession**
   - **Description**: Creates a new session for an authenticated user.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `userId`: The unique identifier of the authenticated user.
     - `username`: The username of the authenticated user.
   - **Return Value**: A session token that can be used to identify and manage the user's session.
   - **Example Usage**:
     ```java
     String sessionToken = UserAuthenticationService.createSession(12345, "john_doe");
     ```

3. **RenewSession**
   - **Description**: Extends the validity of an existing session to ensure continuous access for the authenticated user.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `sessionToken`: The token identifying the current session.
   - **Return Value**: A boolean indicating whether the session was successfully renewed (`true`) or not (`false`).
   - **Example Usage**:
     ```java
     boolean isSessionRenewed = UserAuthenticationService.renewSession("abc123");
     ```

4. **TerminateSession**
   - **Description**: Terminates an existing user session, invalidating the session token.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `sessionToken`: The token identifying the session to be terminated.
   - **Return Value**: A boolean indicating whether the session was successfully terminated (`true`) or not (`false`).
   - **Example Usage**:
     ```java
     boolean isSessionTerminated = UserAuthenticationService.terminateSession("abc123");
     ```

#### Security Considerations
- Ensure that all communication between the client and server is encrypted using HTTPS.
- Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on user credentials.
- Use secure hashing algorithms for storing passwords in the database.

#### Dependencies
- `DatabaseService`: For retrieving user data from the database.
- `EncryptionService`: For encrypting and decrypting sensitive information.

#### Error Handling
The service should handle common errors such as invalid credentials, session timeouts, and network issues gracefully. Detailed error messages or codes can be returned to help with debugging and user feedback.

For more detailed documentation and usage examples, refer to the [API Documentation](https://docs.example.com/api/user-authentication-service) section of our official documentation.

### FunctionDef apply_edits(self, edits)
**apply_edits**: The function of apply_edits is to apply a list of file edits to the corresponding files.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: `edits` (List of tuples containing path, filename, and new lines)

**Code Description**: This method iterates over each edit in the provided list. For every edit, it constructs the full path to the target file using the `abs_root_path` method, which ensures that the paths are correctly resolved relative to the root directory. It then concatenates the new lines into a single string and writes this content to the specified file path using the `write_text` method from an `io` object.

The process involves several steps:
1. **Iterate through edits**: The function loops over each tuple in the `edits` list.
2. **Resolve full path**: For each edit, it uses the `abs_root_path` method to get the absolute path of the file based on the provided relative path and root directory.
3. **Concatenate new lines**: It joins all the new lines into a single string for efficient writing.
4. **Write content**: Finally, it writes this concatenated string to the target file using the `write_text` method.

This function is crucial for applying multiple edits in bulk to files within the project structure, ensuring that changes are made accurately and efficiently across various files.

**Note**: Ensure that the `edits` list contains valid paths and new lines. Also, be mindful of potential permission issues when writing to files, as this operation may fail if the application does not have write permissions for certain directories or files.

```

**Notes:**
- The `password` property and any related methods should never be accessed or modified directly due to security reasons. All password-related operations must be handled through the provided methods.
- Always ensure that sensitive information such as passwords is handled securely, following best practices for data protection.

This documentation provides a clear understanding of how the `UserAuthentication` class functions within the application and how it can be utilized effectively by developers and system administrators.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, models, max_tokens)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the ChatSummary object with models and maximum token count.

**parameters**:
· models: A list or single model used for summarization.
· max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens allowed in the summary.

**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` method initializes an instance of the `ChatSummary` class by setting up its attributes based on the provided parameters. If no models are given, a `ValueError` is raised to ensure that at least one model is specified. The `models` parameter can be either a list or a single model; if it's a single model, it gets converted into a list for uniformity.

The `max_tokens` attribute stores the maximum number of tokens allowed in the summary. This value ensures that the generated summaries do not exceed this limit, which is crucial for preventing API calls from being too long and potentially causing errors.

After setting up these attributes, the method calculates the initial token count using the first model's `token_count` method. The token count is essential for understanding how many tokens are present in a given set of messages, ensuring that the summary generation process adheres to the defined limits.

This initialization step is foundational as it sets up the necessary parameters and context for subsequent operations such as generating summaries or managing chat history efficiently within the defined constraints.

**Note**: Ensure that the models provided have their tokenizers properly initialized before calling `__init__`. The method assumes that the input messages are compatible with the model's tokenizer format. Error handling is in place to manage unexpected issues during initialization, providing fallback behavior when necessary.
***
### FunctionDef too_big(self, messages)
**too_big**: The function of `too_big` is to determine if the total number of tokens in a list of messages exceeds a predefined maximum token limit.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: `messages`: A list of dictionaries representing chat messages, where each dictionary contains "role" and "content" keys.

**Code Description**: 
The function `too_big` evaluates whether the combined token count of all messages in the input list exceeds the class attribute `max_tokens`. Here is a detailed analysis:

- **Tokenization Preparation**: The method calls `self.tokenize(messages)`, which processes each message into a tuple containing the number of tokens and the original message. This step ensures that every message has its token count calculated.
  
- **Total Token Calculation**: After obtaining the list of tokenized messages, it iterates through this list to sum up the total number of tokens using `sum(tokens for tokens, _msg in sized)`. The `_msg` is a placeholder used to ignore the original content during the summation process.

- **Comparison and Return**: Finally, it compares the total token count with `self.max_tokens`. If the total exceeds this limit, it returns `True`, indicating that the message list is too big. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

**Note**: Ensure that the method `token_count` exists within the same class and correctly calculates the number of tokens in a given message. The `max_tokens` attribute should also be defined and properly set according to your application's requirements.

**Output Example**: If the input list contains messages with a total token count exceeding `self.max_tokens`, the function returns `True`. For example:
```
too_big([{'role': 'user', 'content': 'This is a long message that exceeds the max tokens.'}]) -> True
``` 

If the total token count does not exceed `max_tokens`, it returns `False`:
```
too_big([{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Short'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Another short'}]) -> False
``` 

This function is crucial for decision-making processes, such as determining whether a chat history needs to be summarized or split before further processing. It is called by `summarize_start` in the `Coder` class, indicating its importance in managing message lists efficiently.

The `too_big` function works closely with the `tokenize` method and is part of a larger system that manages chat summaries and messages based on token counts to ensure efficient data handling and processing.
***
### FunctionDef tokenize(self, messages)
**tokenize**: The function of `tokenize` is to convert messages into tokenized pairs where each pair consists of the number of tokens and the original message.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: `messages`: A list of dictionaries representing chat messages, where each dictionary contains "role" and "content" keys.

**Code Description**: The function `tokenize` processes a list of chat messages by tokenizing each message into its constituent tokens. It then returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the number of tokens in the message and the original message itself.
- **Loop through Messages**: The function iterates over each message in the input `messages` list.
- **Token Count Calculation**: For each message, it calculates the token count using the method `self.token_count(msg)`, which is assumed to be a method within the same class that returns the number of tokens for a given message.
- **Store Tokenized Data**: The tuple `(tokens, msg)` is appended to the list `sized` containing all tokenized messages.

This function plays a crucial role in preparing data before further processing or analysis. It is called by other methods such as `too_big` and `summarize`, which rely on the token counts for decision-making processes related to message splitting and summarization.

**Note**: Ensure that the method `token_count` exists within the same class and correctly calculates the number of tokens in a given message. The `max_tokens` attribute should also be defined and properly set according to your application's requirements.

**Output Example**: If the input list contains two messages, the output will be a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an integer (number of tokens) and a dictionary representing the original message. For example:
```
[ (2, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hello world'}), (2, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Hi there'}) ]
```

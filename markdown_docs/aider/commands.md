### FunctionDef clone(self)
**clone**: The function of clone is to create a new instance of the Commands class.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters explicitly defined within its method signature.
- `self`: A reference to the current instance of the class, allowing access to methods and attributes of that class.

**Code Description**: 
The `clone` method creates a new instance of the `Commands` class using the current instance's attributes. Here is a detailed breakdown:
1. The method starts with `return Commands(...)`, indicating it returns an object of type `Commands`.
2. Inside the parentheses, various parameters are passed to the `Commands` constructor:
   - `self.io`: Passes the input/output interface of the current instance.
   - `None`: A placeholder parameter that is set to `None`. This might be used for future extensions or when additional arguments need to be added without breaking existing code.
   - `voice_language=self.voice_language`: Copies the voice language setting from the current instance.
   - `verify_ssl=self.verify_ssl`: Copies the SSL verification setting from the current instance.
   - `args=self.args`: Copies the command-line arguments from the current instance.
   - `parser=self.parser`: Copies the argument parser from the current instance.

This method ensures that a new set of commands can be created with similar configurations to the original instance, potentially allowing for parallel or related operations without duplicating code.

**Note**: 
- The use of `None` as a placeholder parameter is a common practice in Python to maintain backward compatibility. It should not be used if it does not have any specific purpose.
- Ensure that all attributes being copied are relevant and necessary for the new instance's functionality.

**Output Example**: 
The return value would be an instance of the `Commands` class with the same configuration as the current instance, but independent in its state. For example:
```python
new_commands = original_instance.clone()
```
Here, `original_instance.clone()` returns a new `Commands` object that is configured similarly to `original_instance`.
***
### FunctionDef __init__(self, io, coder, voice_language, verify_ssl, args, parser, verbose)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the state of an instance of the Commands class.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: io - An instance of the IO class responsible for handling input and output operations.
· parameter2: coder - An instance of the Coder class used for coding-related tasks.
· parameter3: voice_language (optional) - A string indicating the preferred language for voice commands, with a default value of None. If set to "auto", it will be automatically detected as None.
· parameter4: verify_ssl (optional) - A boolean flag to indicate whether SSL certificate verification should be enabled, with a default value of True.
· parameter5: args (optional) - An instance of the argparse.Namespace class containing command-line arguments parsed from user input.
· parameter6: parser (optional) - An instance of the argparse.ArgumentParser class used for parsing command-line arguments.
· parameter7: verbose (optional) - A boolean flag to indicate whether detailed output should be displayed, with a default value of False.

**Code Description**: The __init__ method is the constructor for the Commands class. It sets up the initial state by assigning provided parameters to corresponding instance variables. Here's a detailed breakdown:
- `self.io = io`: Assigns the input/output handler to the `io` attribute.
- `self.coder = coder`: Initializes the coding-related operations with the `coder` object.
- `self.parser = parser`: Sets up the argument parsing mechanism using the provided `parser`.
- `self.args = args`: Stores the parsed command-line arguments in the `args` attribute, if any are provided.
- `self.verbose = verbose`: Determines whether detailed output should be displayed based on the `verbose` flag.

The method also handles the voice_language parameter by setting a default value of None and automatically detecting it as such when set to "auto". This ensures that the instance is properly configured for handling various input scenarios, including voice commands. The `verify_ssl` flag is directly assigned without any modification, ensuring secure connections if required.

Additionally, the method initializes `self.help` to None, which can be used later in the class for providing help or usage information.

**Note**: Ensure that all dependencies like IO and Coder classes are properly defined and imported before using this constructor. The initial state setup is crucial for the proper functioning of the Commands class throughout its lifecycle.

### FunctionDef cmd_chat_mode(self, args)
**cmd_chat_mode**: The function of `cmd_chat_mode` is to switch to a new chat mode based on user input.
**Parameters**:
- parameter1: `args` (str) - A string representing the desired chat mode.

**Code Description**: 
The `cmd_chat_mode` function serves as an interface for switching between different chat modes in the application. It processes the input argument and determines the appropriate action to take based on the provided value. The function first strips any leading or trailing whitespace from the input argument (`args`). It then defines two dictionaries: `valid_formats` and `show_formats`. 

The `valid_formats` dictionary maps each valid edit format to a brief description, while the `show_formats` dictionary provides descriptions for specific chat modes like "help", "ask", and "code". The function checks if the provided argument (`ef`) matches any of these predefined formats or chat modes. If it does not match, an error message is displayed listing all valid options.

If a valid format or chat mode is selected, the function sets the `edit_format` variable accordingly and determines whether to summarize from the coder based on the specific chat mode. For example, if the "code" mode is chosen, the application uses the main model's edit format; for the "ask" mode, it disables summarization.

If no valid input is provided, the function raises a `SwitchCoder` exception with the appropriate parameters to handle the switch in coder mode.

**Note**: Ensure that the input argument (`args`) is correctly formatted and matches one of the predefined chat modes or edit formats. Incorrect input will result in an error message listing all available options.

**Output Example**: 
If the user inputs "code", the function sets `edit_format` to the main model's format and disables summarization, then raises a `SwitchCoder` exception with these parameters. If the input is invalid (e.g., "invalid_mode"), it displays an error message like:
```
Available chat modes: help, ask, code
```
***
### FunctionDef completions_model(self)
**completions_model**: The function of completions_model is to return a list of available models supported by the `litellm.model_cost` dictionary.

**parameters**: This Function has no parameters.
· parameter1: None

**Code Description**: 
The `completions_model` method within the `completions_model` class iterates through the keys of the `litellm.model_cost` dictionary and returns a list of these keys. The `litellm.model_cost` is presumed to be a predefined dictionary that contains information about various models supported by the system, including their cost details.

The method starts with initializing an empty set called `models`. It then uses the `.keys()` method on `litellm.model_cost`, which returns all the keys (model names) in this dictionary. These keys are stored in the `models` variable and returned as a list.

**Note**: Ensure that the `litellm.model_cost` dictionary is properly defined and populated with valid model names before calling this function. Any changes to the models available through `litellm.model_cost` will be reflected in the output of this method.

**Output Example**: If `litellm.model_cost` contains keys such as 'model1', 'model2', and 'model3', then the function would return a list like `['model1', 'model2', 'model3']`.
***
### FunctionDef cmd_models(self, args)
**cmd_models**: The function of `cmd_models` is to search for available models based on partial names provided by the user.
**Parameters**:
· args: The input string containing the partial model name to search for.

**Code Description**: 
The `cmd_models` method processes a command-line argument intended as a partial model name. It first strips any leading or trailing whitespace from the input using `args.strip()`. If the resulting string is not empty, it calls `models.print_matching_models(self.io, args)` to display matching models. Otherwise, it outputs a message asking for a valid partial model name.

This method ensures that users can easily query available models by providing a part of their names. It leverages the `print_matching_models` function from the `aider/models.py` module to perform the actual search and output the results.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the input argument is stripped properly before processing.
- Provide clear feedback if no matching models are found or if the user does not provide a valid partial name.

### FunctionDef is_command(self, inp)
**is_command**: The function of is_command is to determine whether a given input string starts with a command indicator.
**parameters**:
· inp: The input string to be checked.

**Code Description**: 
The `is_command` method checks if the input string starts with either a forward slash (`/`) or an exclamation mark (`!`). If it does, then it returns `True`, indicating that the input is considered a command. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This function primarily serves as a filter to distinguish between regular user inputs and commands.

This method is called by the `preproc_user_input` function in the `Coder` class within the `base_coder.py` module. The `preproc_user_input` function processes the input string and decides whether it should be treated as a command or proceed with further checks such as file mentions or URL detection. If the input is recognized as a command, it is passed to the `run` method of the `commands` object for execution; otherwise, it undergoes additional checks.

**Note**: Ensure that the input string is non-empty before calling this function to avoid unnecessary processing.
**Output Example**: 
```python
>>> is_command("/start")
True
>>> is_command("!help")
True
>>> is_command("hello world")
False
```
***
### FunctionDef get_raw_completions(self, cmd)
**get_raw_completions**: The function of get_raw_completions is to generate raw completions based on a given command.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: cmd (str) - A string representing the command, which must start with a forward slash ("/").
**Code Description**: This method processes the input command by stripping the leading forward slash and replacing hyphens with underscores. It then attempts to retrieve a corresponding raw completion function using dynamic attribute access. If such a function exists, it returns the result of calling that function; otherwise, it returns None.
- The method first checks if the provided `cmd` starts with a forward slash (`/`). An assertion is used for this purpose to ensure the input format is correct.
- The leading forward slash is removed from the command using slicing: `cmd = cmd[1:]`.
- Hyphens in the command are replaced with underscores: `cmd = cmd.replace("-", "_")`.
- Using dynamic attribute access, it tries to find a function named `completions_raw_{cmd}` within the current object. If such a function exists, it is called and its result is returned.
- If no corresponding function is found, the method returns None.

**Note**: Ensure that any custom completion functions are correctly defined with names following the pattern `completions_raw_{command}` where `{command}` is the command name after processing (with leading slash removed and hyphens replaced by underscores).

**Output Example**: 
If the input command is "/start-server", assuming there exists a function named `completions_raw_start_server`, the method would call this function and return its result. If no such function exists, it returns None.
***
### FunctionDef get_completions(self, cmd)
**get_completions**: The function of get_completions is to process and complete commands based on user input.
**parameters**:
· cmd: The command string provided by the user, which starts with a forward slash (/).
**Code Description**: 
The function `get_completions` processes the given command string by performing several steps. First, it asserts that the command starts with a forward slash (`/`). If this assertion fails, the function will raise an `AssertionError`. Next, it removes the leading `/` from the command using slicing. Then, it replaces any hyphens (`-`) in the command with underscores (`_`). This transformation is likely done to map more naturally to Python method names.

After transforming the command, the function attempts to find a corresponding method by calling `getattr(self, f"completions_{cmd}", None)`. If no such method exists (i.e., `fun` is `None`), it returns immediately without further processing. Otherwise, it calls this method and sorts its output before returning it.

**Note**: Ensure that the command provided to `get_completions` always starts with a forward slash (`/`). The function will raise an `AssertionError` if this condition is not met.
**Output Example**: If the user inputs `/delete-file`, assuming there is a method named `completions_delete_file`, the function would call `completions_delete_file()` and return its sorted output.
***
### FunctionDef get_commands(self)
**get_commands**: The function of get_commands is to retrieve a list of command names that start with "cmd_".
**parameters**: This Function has no parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `get_commands` method iterates over all attributes of the current object using `dir(self)`. It filters these attributes by checking if they start with "cmd_". For each matching attribute, it removes the prefix "cmd_" and replaces underscores with hyphens to format the command name. The formatted command names are then added to a list called `commands`, which is returned at the end of the method.

The `get_commands` function serves as a utility to generate a list of available commands that can be used in other methods, such as `matching_commands`. This ensures consistency and ease of use when implementing command-related functionalities. For example, it allows the `basic_help` method to display help for each command by dynamically generating the list of commands.

By using this function, developers can easily manage and update the set of available commands without manually maintaining a separate list in multiple places.
**Note**: Ensure that all methods or attributes starting with "cmd_" are correctly formatted before calling `get_commands`. Any change to these methods should be reflected here as well to maintain consistency.
**Output Example**: If the object has the following methods: `cmd_add`, `cmd_remove`, and `cmd_search`, then `get_commands` would return `['/add', '/remove', '/search']`.
***
### FunctionDef do_run(self, cmd_name, args)
**do_run**: The function of do_run is to execute a command based on its name and arguments.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: cmd_name (str) - The name of the command to be executed.
· parameter2: args (dict) - A dictionary containing the arguments for the command.

**Code Description**: 
The `do_run` function plays a crucial role in executing commands within the system. It takes two parameters: `cmd_name`, which is the name of the command, and `args`, which contains the arguments needed to run the command. The function first normalizes the command name by replacing hyphens with underscores. This ensures that command names are consistent across different input formats.

Next, it constructs a method name based on the normalized command name using string formatting. It then attempts to retrieve this method from the current object instance using `getattr`. If the method does not exist, an error message is outputted via the IO system, indicating that the specified command was not found.

If the method exists, `do_run` calls it with the provided arguments and returns its result. However, if the method execution raises any `ANY_GIT_ERROR`, a specific error message is displayed to indicate that the command could not be completed due to an issue related to Git operations.

The function demonstrates how commands are dynamically handled based on their names, ensuring flexibility in the system's command structure while maintaining robust handling of errors and ambiguities.

**Note**: Ensure that all commands have corresponding methods defined within the class. Pay attention to error handling to provide clear feedback to users when a command is not recognized or fails due to Git operations.

**Output Example**: 
If `cmd_name` is "pull" and `args` contains {"branch": "main"}, the function might output:
```
Error: Command pull not found.
``` 
Alternatively, if the method exists and runs successfully, it returns the result of the command execution.
***
### FunctionDef matching_commands(self, inp)
**matching_commands**: The function of matching_commands is to find commands that match the input string.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: inp (str) - The input command string from which the first word and potential sub-command are extracted.

**Code Description**: This method processes an input command string by extracting the first word as a potential command name. It then filters through all available commands to find those that start with this first word, returning a list of matching commands along with the first word and remaining input.
- The `inp` parameter is stripped of leading and trailing spaces and split into words.
- The first word in the input string is identified as `first_word`, and any subsequent part of the input is stored in `rest_inp`.
- All available commands are retrieved using the `get_commands()` method, which filters out methods starting with "cmd_" and formats them for use.
- A list comprehension checks each command to see if it starts with `first_word` and returns a list of matching commands.
- The function then returns this list along with `first_word` and `rest_inp`.

**Note**: Ensure that all methods or attributes starting with "cmd_" are correctly formatted before calling `get_commands`. Any change to these methods should be reflected here as well to maintain consistency.

**Output Example**: If the input string is "!add person", the function will return `['/add']`, `first_word` as `"add"`, and `rest_inp` as `"person"` after stripping.
***
### FunctionDef run(self, inp)
**run**: The function of run is to execute commands based on user input.
· parameter1: inp (str) - The command input from the user.

**Code Description**: 
The `run` method handles the execution of commands entered by the user or derived from other sources within the system. It performs several key operations:

1. **Command Prefix Handling**: If the input string starts with an exclamation mark (`!`), it triggers a specific event using `self.coder.event("command_run")`. This is likely to log or notify some internal mechanism about command execution.

2. **Direct Command Execution**: For inputs that do not start with `!`, the method proceeds to match the input against known commands.
   - It calls `self.matching_commands(inp)` to get a list of matching commands, along with the first word and remaining part of the input.
   - If no matching commands are found (`matching_commands` returns an empty or null value), it directly executes the command using `self.run(cmd)`, where `cmd` is the full user input.

3. **Command Matching**: The method uses `self.matching_commands(inp)` to find potential matches for the given input. It processes the input, splits it into a first word (`first_word`) and the remaining part (`rest_inp`), and then filters commands based on `first_word`.

4. **Executing Commands**: If matching commands are found, they are processed further. The method iterates over these commands, skipping any empty strings or comments (lines starting with `#`). For each valid command, it logs the execution intent using `self.io.tool_output(f"Executing: {cmd}")` and then runs the command through another instance of the `run` method.

5. **Event Handling**: The method also handles events by calling methods like `self.coder.event("command_run")`, which might be used for logging or other system monitoring purposes.

**Note**: Ensure that all commands are correctly formatted and available in the system before using this method. Any changes to command handling should reflect here as well to maintain consistency.

**Output Example**: If the input is "!add person", it would first check if there's a matching command, then proceed to execute the corresponding add command for adding a person. If no matching commands are found and the input starts with `!`, it will trigger an event but not perform any specific action unless further defined by other parts of the system.

**raw_cmd_commit**: The function of raw_cmd_commit is to commit changes to the git repository based on user input.
**parameters**: 
· args: Optional string representing the commit message.

**Code Description**: This function handles the process of committing changes to a Git repository. It begins by checking if there is an active Git repository associated with the current environment using `self.coder.repo`. If no repository is found, it outputs an error message via `self.io.tool_error` and exits early. Next, it checks whether any changes are present in the repository with `self.coder.repo.is_dirty()`. If no changes exist, a warning message is displayed through `self.io.tool_tool_warning`.

If both the repository check passes and there are uncommitted changes, the function proceeds to create a commit message using the provided argument or an empty string if none was given. Finally, it calls `self.coder.repo.commit(message=commit_message)` to perform the actual commit operation.

This function is called by another method, `cmd_commit`, which serves as a higher-level wrapper that catches any potential errors during the commit process and handles them appropriately by displaying error messages via `self.io.tool_error`. This design ensures that even if an issue arises while committing changes, the user receives clear feedback about what went wrong.

**Note**: Ensure that the Git repository is properly initialized before calling this function. Also, be aware of any potential issues related to network connectivity or permissions that might affect the commit process.

**Output Example**: 
- If no changes are detected: "No more changes to commit."
- If a commit message is provided and successfully committed: No explicit return value; the repository is updated.
- If an error occurs during the commit operation (e.g., due to network issues): "Unable to complete commit: [error details]."

### FunctionDef cmd_clear(self, args)
**cmd_clear**: The function of cmd_clear is to clear the chat history.

**parameters**:
· args: Command-line arguments passed to the function. In this case, it appears that no specific arguments are required as the function does not utilize any parameters within its implementation.

**Code Description**:
The `cmd_clear` method is responsible for clearing the chat history by invoking the `_clear_chat_history` method. This is achieved through a direct call to `self._clear_chat_history()`, where `self` refers to the instance of the class that contains this method. The purpose of `cmd_clear` is to provide a command or action within the application, likely a user interface element or a console command, which when executed, results in the removal of all previous chat messages.

The `_clear_chat_history` method, which is called by `cmd_clear`, resets two specific message history lists: `done_messages` and `cur_messages`. These are attributes of the `coder` instance within the class. By setting these lists to empty arrays (`[]`), any residual data from prior interactions are removed, ensuring a clean slate for future communications.

From a functional perspective, `cmd_clear` serves as an interface to `_clear_chat_history`, providing a user-friendly way to trigger history clearing. This method is part of a larger system designed to manage and reset chat sessions or interactions within the application.

**Note**: Ensure that the coder instance has been properly initialized before calling `_clear_chat_history`. Although `cmd_clear` does not explicitly use any parameters, it relies on the internal state of the class for its operation. This method is intended to be used by command methods like `cmd_clear` and `cmd_reset`, but should not be called directly from outside this class.
***
### FunctionDef _drop_all_files(self)
**_drop_all_files**: The function of _drop_all_files is to clear all file references from memory.

**parameters**: 
· None

**Code Description**: 

The `_drop_all_files` method is responsible for resetting the internal state of the `Commands` object by clearing out any previously stored absolute file paths and read-only file paths. Specifically, it sets both `self.coder.abs_fnames` and `self.coder.abs_read_only_fnames` to empty sets.

This function is called in two different contexts within the project:
1. **In `cmd_reset`**: The `_drop_all_files` method is invoked as part of a broader reset operation that also clears chat history. This ensures that all file references are removed, and the user starts with a clean slate.
2. **In `cmd_drop`**: When the command to drop files (`cmd_drop`) is executed without any specific filenames provided, `_drop_all_files` is called as part of the default action. This effectively removes all files from the chat session.

By clearing these sets, the method ensures that subsequent operations do not reference old file data, maintaining the integrity and cleanliness of the system state.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that this method is called appropriately in different commands to maintain consistent behavior across the application.
- The `abs_fnames` set contains all absolute file paths currently in use or considered relevant for the session. Similarly, `abs_read_only_fnames` holds read-only files that should be excluded from certain operations.
- Always call `_drop_all_files` at appropriate points in your code to avoid unintended side effects and ensure correct state management.
***
### FunctionDef _clear_chat_history(self)
**_clear_chat_history**: The function of _clear_chat_history is to clear both the done_messages and cur_messages lists associated with the coder instance.

**parameters**: 
· None

**Code Description**: 
The `_clear_chat_history` method is responsible for resetting two specific message history lists: `done_messages` and `cur_messages`, which are attributes of the `coder` instance. By setting these lists to empty arrays, any previous chat history or messages that were recorded are removed. This function plays a crucial role in ensuring that there is no residual data from previous interactions when new ones begin.

This method is called within other command functions such as `cmd_clear` and `cmd_reset`. In the context of `cmd_clear`, `_clear_chat_history` is invoked directly to clear the chat history, providing a clean slate for subsequent interactions. In `cmd_reset`, it is part of a larger process that also involves dropping all files, emphasizing its role in comprehensive state resets.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the coder instance has been properly initialized before calling `_clear_chat_history`.
- This method is internal and should not be called directly from outside this class; it is intended to be used by command methods like `cmd_clear` and `cmd_reset`.

#### FunctionDef fmt(v)
**fmt**: The function of `fmt` is to format an integer value by adding commas as thousands separators and right-aligning it within a specified width.
**Parameters**:
· v: The input value that needs to be formatted, expected to be an integer or convertible to an integer.
**Code Description**: 
The `fmt` function takes a single parameter `v`, which is expected to be an integer or a string representing an integer. It first converts the input `v` into an integer using `int(v)`. Then it formats this integer by adding commas as thousands separators using the `format` function with the `,` format specifier. Finally, it right-aligns the formatted string within a specified width using the `rjust` method.

Here is a detailed analysis of each step:
1. **Input Conversion**: The input value `v` is passed to the `int()` function to convert it into an integer. If `v` cannot be converted to an integer, this will raise a `ValueError`.
2. **Formatting with Commas**: The formatted string is created using the `format` method of strings in Python: `format(int(v), ",")`. This adds commas as thousands separators to the number.
3. **Right-Justification**: The resulting string is then right-aligned within a specified width, which is provided by the caller but not defined in this function. You can assume that the width is passed as an external parameter or constant.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the input `v` is valid and can be converted to an integer.
- The width should be explicitly defined when calling this function; otherwise, it may lead to unexpected behavior.
- If the input value `v` is already a string with commas (e.g., "1000"), it will still be converted to an integer first and then formatted again, which might not preserve the original comma format.

**Output Example**: 
If you call `fmt("1234567")`, assuming the width is 10, the output would be `" 1,234,567"` (with spaces added to the left to make it 10 characters wide).

### FunctionDef cmd_undo(self, args)
# Object Documentation: `UserAuthentication`

## Overview

`UserAuthentication` is a critical component responsible for managing user authentication processes within our application. This module handles user login, logout, session management, and token generation/retrieval.

## Key Features

- **Login**: Facilitates user login through username/password validation.
- **Logout**: Ensures secure and clean logout of users from the system.
- **Session Management**: Tracks active sessions to maintain user state across multiple requests.
- **Token Generation/Retrieval**: Manages token-based authentication for secure API access.

## Usage

### Login

To authenticate a user, you need to provide their username and password. Upon successful validation, `UserAuthentication` generates an access token that can be used for subsequent authenticated requests.

```python
response = UserAuthentication.login(username='johndoe', password='password123')
access_token = response['token']
```

### Logout

To log out a user, you need to provide the access token obtained during login. The `logout` method will invalidate the session and clear any associated tokens.

```python
UserAuthentication.logout(token=access_token)
```

### Session Management

The module maintains an active session for each logged-in user, tracking their state across multiple requests. Sessions are automatically managed by the system but can be manually invalidated using the `logout` method as shown above.

### Token Generation/Retrieval

Tokens are generated and retrieved based on user authentication status. Tokens can be used to secure API endpoints and ensure that only authenticated users can access protected resources.

## Configuration

The `UserAuthentication` module is configured via a settings file, which includes details such as:

- **Secret Key**: Used for token signing.
- **Expiry Time**: Defines the duration of session validity.
- **Allowed Origins**: Specifies the domains from which requests are allowed.

Example configuration snippet:

```python
AUTH_SECRET_KEY = 'your_secret_key_here'
AUTH_EXPIRY_TIME = 3600  # 1 hour in seconds
ALLOWED_ORIGINS = ['http://localhost:3000', 'https://example.com']
```

## Error Handling

- **Invalid Credentials**: If the provided username or password is incorrect, an `AuthenticationError` will be raised.
- **Token Expired**: If a token is used after its expiry time, a `TokenExpiredError` will be thrown.
- **Session Not Found**: If no active session exists for the given user, a `SessionNotFoundError` will be raised.

## Security Considerations

- Ensure that all sensitive information, such as passwords and tokens, are handled securely.
- Use HTTPS to encrypt communication between client and server.
- Regularly update and rotate secret keys to enhance security.

## Dependencies

- `Flask`: For web application integration.
- `PyJWT`: For token generation and validation.
- `bcrypt`: For secure password hashing.

## Example Integration

Here is a simplified example of integrating `UserAuthentication` into a Flask application:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from user_authentication_module import UserAuthentication

app = Flask(__name__)
auth = UserAuthentication()

@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    username = request.form['username']
    password = request.form['password']
    response = auth.login(username=username, password=password)
    return jsonify(response)

@app.route('/logout', methods=['POST'])
def logout():
    token = request.headers.get('Authorization')
    if not token:
        return 'Missing Authorization Header', 401
    auth.logout(token=token)
    return 'Logged out successfully'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

### FunctionDef raw_cmd_undo(self, args)
**raw_cmd_undo**: The function of `raw_cmd_undo` is to undo the last git commit if it was made by `aider`.

**parameters**:
· args: Command-line arguments passed to the command.

**Code Description**: 
The `raw_cmd_undo` method performs a series of checks and operations to ensure that the last git commit can be safely undone. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Check for Git Repository**: The first step is to verify if there is an active git repository. If no repository is found, it issues an error message using `self.io.tool_error` and exits early.

2. **Identify Last Commit**: It retrieves the last commit from the current branch using `self.coder.repo.get_head_commit()`. If there are no commits or parents for the head commit, it again issues an error indicating that this is the first commit in the repository and thus cannot be undone.

3. **Validate Last Commit**: The method checks if the last commit was made by `aider` using `self.coder.aider_commit_hashes`. If not, it provides a warning message suggesting alternative commands but exiting early to prevent accidental data loss.

4. **Check for Multiple Parents**: It verifies that the last commit has only one parent. If there are multiple parents, an error is issued because this scenario complicates the undo process and could lead to conflicts or unintended changes.

5. **File Changes Check**: For each file changed in the last commit, it ensures that no uncommitted changes exist by checking if the files are clean using `self.coder.repo.repo.is_dirty(path=fname)`. If any file has uncommitted changes, an error is issued and the process aborts.

6. **Repository Integrity Check**: It checks whether the local HEAD matches the remote origin’s HEAD to ensure that the last commit hasn't already been pushed to a remote repository. If they match, it issues an error because undoing would be destructive in this case.

7. **Restore Files**: For each file changed in the last commit, it attempts to restore the state of these files using `self.coder.repo.repo.git.checkout("HEAD~1", file_path)`. It tracks which files were successfully restored and which failed.

8. **Reset HEAD**: After ensuring all conditions are met, it resets the repository’s head back by one commit using `self.coder.repo.repo.git.reset("--soft", "HEAD~1")`.

9. **Output Confirmation**: Finally, it provides a confirmation message detailing what changes have been undone and the current state of the repository.

**Note**: The method handles various error conditions rigorously to prevent accidental data loss or corruption. It ensures that only safe undos are performed by checking for multiple parents, uncommitted changes, and remote synchronization status.

**Output Example**: 
```
Removed: abcdef123456 "Add initial setup"
Now at:  bcdef7890123 "Initial commit"
```
***
### FunctionDef cmd_diff(self, args)
**cmd_diff**: The function of `cmd_diff` is to display the diff of changes since the last message.
· parameter1: args (empty string by default)

**Code Description**: 
The `cmd_diff` method acts as a wrapper for displaying the difference between the current commit and the previous commit message in a Git repository. It first checks if there is a valid git repository using the attribute `self.coder.repo`. If no repository is found, it outputs an error message via `self.io.tool_error`.

Next, it retrieves the SHA of the current HEAD commit to ensure at least one commit exists. If the repository is empty or has no commits, another warning is displayed.

The method then determines which commit message should be used for comparison. It checks if there is a previous commit message stored in `self.last_aider_commit_message`. If so, it uses this as the reference point; otherwise, it defaults to considering the initial commit message as the last known state.

Once the appropriate commit messages are identified, any differences between them are calculated and displayed using `self.io.print()`. This output is caught by a mock print function in test cases to ensure correctness.

The method also handles potential errors gracefully. If there's an issue with fetching or comparing the commit messages, it catches exceptions and prints an error message via `self.io.tool_error`.

**Note**: Ensure that `self.show_diffs` is set to True for this command to run as intended. The method relies on having a valid `Coder` instance with a properly configured repository and output interface (`io`). Any changes made to the file system or commit history should be reflected in the repository state before calling this function, as it directly references the current commit messages stored in the `Coder` object.
***
### FunctionDef raw_cmd_diff(self, args)
**raw_cmd_diff**: The function of `raw_cmd_diff` is to display the difference between the current commit and the previous commit message.

**parameters**: 
· parameter1: args (empty string by default)
- This parameter currently does not serve any specific purpose as it is always an empty string, but it could be used in future implementations for additional arguments if necessary.

**Code Description**: The `raw_cmd_diff` function performs several checks to ensure that a valid git repository exists and can provide the required commit information. It then calculates the diff between the current HEAD commit and either the second-to-last commit message or the commit before the last one, depending on the availability of commit messages. If there are no changes since the last commit message, it outputs a warning; otherwise, it prints out the diff.

The function starts by checking if a git repository exists using `self.coder.repo`. If not found, an error is displayed and the function returns early. It then retrieves the SHA of the current HEAD commit to ensure there is at least one commit in the repository. If no commits are present, another warning is issued before exiting.

Next, it determines the commit message hash to use for comparison by checking if there is a previous commit message stored (`self.coder.commit_before_message`). If so, and this message is not the same as the current HEAD, it uses the second-to-last commit message. Otherwise, it defaults to using the current HEAD's parent commit.

If no valid commits are found for comparison or no changes have been made since the last commit, a warning is displayed. Otherwise, the function calls `self.coder.repo.diff_commits` with appropriate parameters to get the diff between the two commits and prints it out via `self.io.print(diff)`.

The `cmd_diff` method in the calling context acts as a wrapper for this functionality, handling any potential Git errors that might occur during execution. If an error is encountered, it catches the exception and displays a user-friendly error message instead of letting the program crash.

**Note**: Ensure that the `self.coder.repo`, `self.io.tool_error`, `self.io.tool_warning`, `self.io.tool_output`, and `self.coder.commit_before_message` attributes are properly initialized before calling this method. Also, make sure that `self.coder.pretty` is set to a valid pretty format for the repository.

**Output Example**: 
```
Diff since 5b6c7d8...
```
***
### FunctionDef quote_fname(self, fname)
**quote_fname**: The function of quote_fname is to ensure that file names are properly quoted if they contain spaces but do not already have quotes around them.
**Parameters**:
· parameter1: `fname` - A string representing the file name to be processed.

**Code Description**: 
The function `quote_fname` checks whether a given file name (`fname`) contains any spaces and does not already have quotes around it. If these conditions are met, the function wraps the file name in double quotes (""). This is done to ensure that the file name is correctly interpreted as a single entity when used in contexts where spaces need to be preserved (e.g., command-line arguments or configuration files).

The function performs the following steps:
1. It checks if there are any spaces within `fname` using the condition `" " in fname`.
2. If no quotes are present around the file name (`" not in fname`), it wraps the file name in double quotes.
3. The modified (or unchanged) file name is then returned.

This function is crucial for ensuring that file names containing spaces are correctly handled, especially when they need to be passed as arguments or used in contexts where spaces must be preserved but are otherwise significant (e.g., command-line utilities).

**Note**: This function is called by other methods such as `completions_add` and `completions_drop`, which generate file name completions for different operations. The `quote_fname` ensures that these file names are properly formatted before they are used.

**Output Example**: 
- If the input `fname` is `"example file.txt"`, it will be returned unchanged.
- If the input `fname` is `example file.txt`, it will be transformed to `"example file.txt"` and then returned.
***
### FunctionDef completions_raw_read_only(self, document, complete_event)
**completions_raw_read_only**: The function of completions_raw_read_only is to generate file name completions based on user input.

**Parameters**:
· parameter1: `document` - A document object containing information about the current text buffer and cursor position.
· parameter2: `complete_event` - An event object that provides context for completion operations, such as whether a specific key has been pressed.

**Code Description**: 
The function `completions_raw_read_only` processes user input to generate file name completions. It first extracts the text before the cursor using `document.get_text_before_cursor()`. This text is then used to determine relevant file names in the current working directory by filtering out any files that are already present in the chat history.

1. **Extracting User Input**: The function starts by retrieving the text before the cursor from the `document` object.
2. **Filtering Files**: It uses this text as a prefix to filter all relative files in the current directory, excluding those that have been previously mentioned in the chat history using `self.coder.get_inchat_relative_files()`.
3. **Formatting File Names**: The remaining file names are passed through the `quote_fname` function to ensure proper handling of spaces and other special characters.
4. **Generating Completions**: These formatted file names are then returned as possible completions for the user's input.

**Note**: Ensure that the coder object has been properly initialized and contains valid data for `get_all_relative_files()` and `get_inchat_relative_files()`. The function assumes that these methods return sets of file names.

The function is called by other completion functions like `completions_raw_load` and `completions_raw_save`, which delegate the task of generating completions to this method. This ensures a consistent approach across different command scenarios while maintaining flexibility in handling specific user inputs.

**Output Example**: If the current directory contains files named "example.txt", "test file.txt", and "script.py", and "test file.txt" is already in the chat history, the returned list would be `["\"test file.txt\"", "example.txt", "script.py"]`.
#### FunctionDef get_paths
**get_paths**: The function of get_paths is to return a list containing the root path of the coder instance if it exists; otherwise, it returns None.
**parameters**: This Function has no parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The function `get_paths` checks whether the `root` attribute of the `coder` instance (assumed to be an instance variable within the class) is set. If `self.coder.root` is not empty or exists, it returns a list containing this root path. Otherwise, if `self.coder.root` does not exist or is None, the function returns None.
```python
def get_paths():
    # Check if self.coder.root exists and is not None
    return [self.coder.root] if self.coder.root else None
```
This concise check ensures that only when a valid root path is available, it is returned. If no such path is present, the function gracefully returns `None`.

**Note**: Ensure that `self.coder` has been properly initialized with an attribute `root`. This function should be called in contexts where the coder's root path might be needed for further processing.

**Output Example**: 
If `self.coder.root` is set to "/home/user/project", the output would be:
```
['/home/user/project']
``` 

If `self.coder.root` is not set or is None, the function returns:
```
None
```
***
***
### FunctionDef completions_add(self)
**completions_add**: The function of completions_add is to generate a list of file names that are eligible for completion after certain commands.
**Parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: `self` - The instance of the class, which provides access to necessary methods and attributes.

**Code Description**: 
The function `completions_add` works by first collecting all relative files in the current working directory using `get_all_relative_files()` from the coder object. These files are stored in a set called `files`. Next, it removes any file names that are already included in the chat history using `get_inchat_relative_files()`, ensuring that only unique and relevant file names remain.

To ensure proper handling of file names with spaces, each remaining file name is processed through the `quote_fname` function. This step is crucial because `quote_fname` ensures that file names containing spaces are properly quoted ("") to prevent issues when these names are used in contexts where spaces need to be preserved (e.g., command-line arguments).

Finally, the modified list of file names is returned. These file names are then utilized by other methods or functions within the project for generating appropriate completions or suggestions.

This function is called by `completions_raw_read_only`, which processes commands and generates relevant file name completions based on user input. The use of `quote_fname` ensures that all file names, especially those with spaces, are correctly formatted before being used in any context where they need to be preserved as single entities.

**Note**: Ensure that the coder object has been properly initialized and contains valid data for `get_all_relative_files()` and `get_inchat_relative_files()`. The function assumes that these methods return sets of file names.

**Output Example**: 
If the current directory contains files named "example.txt", "test file.txt", and "script.py", and "test file.txt" is already in the chat history, the returned list would be `["\"test file.txt\"", "example.txt", "script.py"]`.

### FunctionDef completions_drop(self)
**completions_drop**: The function of completions_drop is to generate a list of file names that need to be dropped from completion suggestions.
**Parameters**:
· parameter1: `self` - An instance of the class containing the method.

**Code Description**: 
The `completions_drop` method performs several steps to prepare a list of files for dropping from completion suggestions:

1. **Retrieve Relative Files**: It starts by calling `self.coder.get_inchat_relative_files()`, which returns a list of relative file names that are currently in the chat context.
2. **Identify Read-Only Files**: Next, it uses a list comprehension to generate another list of read-only files by calling `self.coder.get_rel_fname(fn)` for each file name in `self.coder.abs_read_only_fnames`. This retrieves the relative paths of these read-only files.

4. **Quote File Names**: Finally, it ensures that all file names in `all_files` are properly quoted by calling `self.quote_fname(fn)` for each file name in the combined list.

The purpose of quoting is to handle cases where file names contain spaces and need to be treated as single entities when used in command-line or configuration contexts. This step ensures that the file names are correctly interpreted, especially if they will be passed as arguments later.

**Note**: The `quote_fname` method is crucial for ensuring that file names containing spaces are properly formatted before being used. This function is called by other methods such as `completions_add` and `completions_drop`, which generate file name completions for different operations.

**Output Example**: 
If the relative files in the chat context are `['file1.txt', 'dir/example file2.txt']` and the read-only files are `['/path/to/read_only_file1.txt', '/path/to/another_read_only_file.txt']`, after calling `completions_drop`, the returned list might look like:
```
["'file1.txt'", "'dir/example file2.txt'", "'/path/to/read_only_file1.txt'", "'/path/to/another_read_only_file.txt'"]
```

### FunctionDef cmd_git(self, args)
**cmd_git**: The function of cmd_git is to execute a Git command within the context of the project.
**parameters**: 
· self: The instance of the Commands class that contains the method.
· args: A string representing the Git command to be executed.

**Code Description**: The `cmd_git` method in the `Commands` class is designed to run Git commands from within a Python program. It takes an argument `args`, which is expected to be a valid Git command, and executes it using the `subprocess.run` function. Here's a detailed breakdown of what happens:

1. **Command Construction**: The provided `args` are concatenated with a "git" prefix to form the full command string.
2. **Environment Setup**: An environment dictionary is created by copying the current environment (`os.environ`). This ensures that any existing environment variables are preserved, except for setting `GIT_EDITOR` to "true", which might be used to specify an editor for Git operations.
3. **Command Execution**: The `subprocess.run` function is called with several parameters:
   - `args`: The constructed command string.
   - `stdout=subprocess.PIPE`: Captures the standard output of the command.
   - `stderr=subprocess.STDOUT`: Merges the standard error into the standard output, making it easier to handle both streams together.
   - `text=True`: Ensures that the output is returned as a string rather than bytes.
   - `env=env`: Passes the modified environment dictionary to the subprocess.
   - `shell=True`: Executes the command through the shell, allowing for complex command lines and environment variable substitution.
   - `encoding=self.io.encoding` and `errors="replace"`: Ensures that the output is decoded according to the project's encoding settings, handling any decoding errors by replacing problematic characters.

4. **Error Handling**: If an exception occurs during the execution of the subprocess, it catches the exception and logs an error message using `self.io.tool_error`.

5. **Output Processing**: The method checks if the combined output (`result.stdout`) is not None. If so, it outputs the result to the `io` object's tool output.

This function allows for seamless integration of Git operations within a Python program, providing a way to run complex Git commands and handle their output programmatically.

**Note**: Ensure that the environment variable `GIT_EDITOR` is set appropriately if your application requires interaction with an editor during Git operations. Also, be mindful of security implications when using `shell=True`, as it can introduce vulnerabilities if not used carefully.

**Output Example**: If you run `cmd_git("commit -a -m 'Initial commit'")`, the method will execute a Git commit command and return the output of this command, which typically includes confirmation messages about the files being added and committed. The exact content of the output depends on what the specific Git command does.

### FunctionDef cmd_exit(self, args)
**cmd_exit**: The function of cmd_exit is to exit the application.
**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: args (This parameter is not used within the function and can be considered as optional or placeholder.)

**Code Description**: 
The `cmd_exit` method does not take any active input from its `args` parameter, which might suggest it was intended for additional functionality but is currently unused. The primary purpose of this method is to invoke the `sys.exit()` function, which terminates the Python script and exits the application.

In more detail:
- **Line 1**: `def cmd_exit(self, args):` - This line defines a method named `cmd_exit` that takes two parameters: `self`, which refers to the instance of the class, and `args`. However, `args` is not utilized within the function body.
- **Line 2**: `"Exit the application"` - This is a docstring enclosed in triple quotes, providing a brief description of what the method does. It states that the purpose of this method is to exit the application.
- **Line 3**: `sys.exit()` - This line calls the `exit` function from the `sys` module, which terminates the current program execution and exits the application.

**Note**: The `args` parameter in this method is currently not utilized. Ensure that any additional parameters are necessary for future development or remove them if they are not needed to avoid confusion.
***
### FunctionDef cmd_quit(self, args)
**cmd_quit**: The function of cmd_quit is to exit the application.
**Parameters**:
· parameter1: self - This is a reference to the instance of the class that the method belongs to. It is used to access variables and methods of the class.
· args - These are optional arguments passed to the function, but in this case, they are not utilized within the function.

**Code Description**: The function cmd_quit is defined within the Commands class and takes a single parameter self (which refers to the instance of the class). It also accepts an optional argument args, although it does not make use of this argument. The primary functionality of this method is to call sys.exit(), which terminates the execution of the program.

The use of sys.exit() immediately stops the running application without executing any remaining code in the current module or any child modules. This makes cmd_quit a crucial function for safely exiting the application when necessary, such as when the user requests to quit from within the application.

**Note**: Ensure that all other cleanup tasks are handled before calling sys.exit(). For instance, save any unsaved data and close open files or network connections gracefully. Additionally, make sure that the sys module is imported at the top of your file for this function to work properly.
***
### FunctionDef cmd_ls(self, args)
**cmd_ls**: The function of cmd_ls is to list all known files and indicate which are included in the chat session.
**parameters**: 
· self: An instance of the class containing methods and attributes relevant to file management and output handling.
· args: Not explicitly defined in the provided code, but typically refers to command-line arguments that might be used for additional filtering or sorting options.

**Code Description**: The function cmd_ls performs a detailed listing of files based on their inclusion status in various lists. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **File Collection and Categorization**:
   - `files = self.coder.get_all_relative_files()`: Retrieves all relative file paths from the coder's context.
   - Two empty lists are initialized: `other_files` for files not included in the chat session, `chat_files` for files that are part of the chat session, and `read_only_files` for read-only files.

2. **Categorization by Inclusion Status**:
   - A loop iterates over each file path to determine its inclusion status.
   - For each file, it converts the relative path to an absolute path using `self.coder.abs_root_path(file)`.
   - If the absolute path exists in `self.coder.abs_fnames`, the file is considered part of the chat session and added to `chat_files`. Otherwise, it is categorized as `other_files`.

3. **Handling Read-Only Files**:
   - Another loop processes read-only files by iterating over `self.coder.abs_read_only_fnames`.
   - For each absolute path, it retrieves the relative file path using `self.coder.get_rel_fname(abs_file_path)` and appends it to `read_only_files`.

4. **Output Generation**:
   - If no files are found in any of the categories (`chat_files`, `other_files`, or `read_only_files`), a message is output indicating that there are no relevant files.
   - For each category that contains files, a header is printed followed by the list of file paths.

5. **Output Display**:
   - The function uses `self.io.tool_output()` to display messages and lists on the console or any other output device connected to the io object.

**Note**: Ensure that all necessary methods (`get_all_relative_files`, `abs_root_path`, `abs_fnames`, `abs_read_only_fnames`, `get_rel_fname`, `tool_output`) are correctly implemented elsewhere in the class hierarchy for this function to work as intended. Also, handle edge cases where `args` might be empty or not provided.

**Output Example**: 
```
Repo files not in the chat:
  file1.py
  script.sh

Read-only files:
  config.json
Files in chat:
  report.docx
```
***
### FunctionDef basic_help(self)
**basic_help**: The function of basic_help is to display help information for all available commands.
**parameters**: This Function has no parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The `basic_help` method iterates over the list of commands obtained from the `get_commands` method, which retrieves a sorted list of command names starting with "cmd_". For each command, it formats the name and checks if there is a corresponding method defined in the current object. If such a method exists, its docstring (description) is retrieved using `getattr` and displayed along with the formatted command name. If no method is found for a given command, a message indicating that no description is available is outputted.

The formatting of the command names ensures consistency by padding them to a uniform width, making the help information more readable. The `self.io.tool_output` function is used to display each line of the formatted command name and its associated description or error message. After displaying all commands, an additional blank line is added for better readability.

At the end of the method, it provides guidance on how to seek further assistance by suggesting the use of `/help <question>` to ask specific questions about using Aider.

**Note**: Ensure that all methods or attributes starting with "cmd_" are correctly formatted before calling `get_commands`. Any change to these methods should be reflected here as well to maintain consistency. This ensures that the help information is always up-to-date and relevant, providing users with accurate descriptions of available commands.

### FunctionDef cmd_ask(self, args)
**cmd_ask**: The function of `cmd_ask` is to ask questions about the code base without editing any files.
**parameters**:
· args: The question or topic to be asked during the chat session.

**Code Description**: 
The `cmd_ask` method is responsible for handling user queries by leveraging a generic chat command mechanism. It ensures that users can pose questions related to their understanding of the codebase, without requiring any file modifications. This function checks if the provided arguments are empty and prompts the user with an error message if no question or topic is specified. If valid input is received, it creates a `Coder` instance configured for chat mode using the `_generic_chat_command` method.

The `cmd_ask` function calls `_generic_chat_command`, passing the provided arguments along with the "chat" format as parameters. This setup ensures that the chat session behaves appropriately for user queries without altering any code files. The result of this interaction is then used to determine how to proceed, potentially raising a `SwitchCoder` exception if necessary.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the input question or topic is provided when calling `cmd_ask`. If no valid input is given, the function will display an error message.
- The method relies on proper configuration of the `io` and `coder` objects to handle user interactions correctly.

**Output Example**: 
If a user inputs "What is the purpose of this function?", the output might look like:
```
The purpose of this function is to ask questions about the codebase without modifying any files.
```
***
### FunctionDef cmd_code(self, args)
**cmd_code**: The function of cmd_code is to initiate a chat command that prompts the user for changes to their code.
**parameters**: 
· args: The input arguments provided by the user, which may include a question or topic related to the coding task.

**Code Description**: 
The `cmd_code` method is responsible for handling commands that require interaction with the user regarding code modifications. It first checks if the provided arguments are empty or contain only whitespace using `args.strip()`. If no valid input is found, it raises an error message indicating that a question or topic needs to be provided.

If valid arguments are present, the method proceeds by creating a new coder instance through the `_generic_chat_command` method. This new coder is configured with the necessary parameters such as the input/output interface (`self.io`), the current coder object (`self.coder`), and the specified edit format (`edit_format`). The `summarize_from_coder` parameter is set to `False`, indicating that no summary should be generated from the existing coder.

The method then processes the user's message by invoking the `run` method on the new coder instance, passing in the arguments. After this interaction, it raises a `SwitchCoder` event, signaling a transition back to the original coder state while retaining certain attributes like the edit format and summary behavior settings.

**Note**: Ensure that the input provided via `args` is meaningful and relevant to avoid unnecessary errors or unexpected behaviors. The edit format specified should be appropriate for the task at hand to ensure smooth interaction with the coding process.

**Output Example**: 
The method returns a `SwitchCoder` event, which triggers a transition back to the original coder state after the chat command has been processed. This could involve displaying new code suggestions or updates based on the user's input.
***
### FunctionDef cmd_architect(self, args)
**cmd_architect**: The function of cmd_architect is to enter architect mode for discussing high-level design and architecture.
**Parameters**:
· args: Command-line arguments provided by the user.

**Code Description**: 
The `cmd_architect` method serves as an entry point into a specialized mode where users can engage in discussions about high-level system or application design. This method calls another internal function, `_generic_chat_command`, which handles the actual execution of the chat command with specific parameters. The purpose of `cmd_architect` is to set up the context for such discussions by invoking the appropriate underlying mechanism.

The method first checks if any arguments have been provided via `args`. If no arguments are present (i.e., `args.strip()` returns an empty string), it raises a tool error indicating that users need to provide a question or topic related to architect mode. This ensures that only meaningful input triggers the subsequent steps of the command execution.

If valid arguments are provided, the method proceeds by creating a new instance of the `Coder` class with specific parameters:
- `io`: The input/output interface for handling user interactions.
- `from_coder`: The current coder object, used as a reference or context when creating a new coder instance.
- `edit_format`: A string indicating the format in which the chat should be conducted (in this case, "architect").
- `summarize_from_coder`: A boolean flag set to False, indicating that no summarization of existing coder state is required.

After setting up these parameters, the method calls the `run` method on the newly created `Coder` instance with the user message (`args`) as input. This initiates the chat session in architect mode.

Finally, the method raises a `SwitchCoder` exception to switch to the new coder context while maintaining certain properties such as not summarizing from the original coder and showing no announcements.

**Note**: Ensure that valid arguments are always provided when invoking this function; otherwise, it will raise an error. The user should be aware of the specific requirements for entering architect mode.

**Output Example**: 
The output would typically be a chat session initiated in architect mode with the provided input as the initial message. For example:
```
User: What considerations should we take into account when designing a microservices architecture?
Coder: In microservices, it's crucial to consider modularity, scalability, and fault tolerance. Let’s discuss each aspect.
```

   - For each command in the sorted list, it constructs a formatted command name by converting underscores to hyphens and removing the leading "cmd_".
   - It then attempts to get the corresponding method using `getattr(self, cmd_method_name)`.
   - If the method exists, its docstring is extracted and used as the description. This description is appended to the markdown table.
   - If no such method exists (i.e., `None`), an empty description is added.

3. **Finalization**:
   - After processing all commands, a newline is appended to `res`.
   - The final string `res` containing the markdown-formatted help document is returned.

The relationship with its callees in the project from a functional perspective:
- **get_commands**: This method is called to retrieve a list of command names. It ensures that only methods starting with "cmd_" are included, which are then used by `get_help_md` to generate the help documentation.
- The use of `getattr` and dynamic method resolution in `get_help_md` relies on the consistent naming convention (methods starting with "cmd_") enforced by `get_commands`.

**Note**: Ensure that all methods or attributes starting with "cmd_" are correctly formatted before calling `get_commands`. Any change to these methods should be reflected here as well to maintain consistency.

**Output Example**: 
If the object has the following methods: `cmd_add`, `cmd_remove`, and `cmd_search`, then `get_help_md` would return a markdown string like:
```
|Command|Description|
|:------|:----------|
| **/add** | Add new items. |
| **/remove** | Remove existing items. |
| **/search** | Search for specific items. |
```

    if results:
        print(results)
    manager.commit_transaction()
else:
    print("Failed to connect or execute query.")
    
manager.close_connection()
```

## Notes

- The `DatabaseManager` class assumes that the database connection and transaction handling are properly configured according to best practices.
- Error handling is implemented to catch and log any exceptions, ensuring that the application can gracefully handle issues without crashing.

This documentation provides a clear understanding of how to use the `DatabaseManager` class effectively.

### FunctionDef cmd_paste(self, args)
**cmd_paste**: The function of cmd_paste is to paste an image or text from the clipboard into the chat, optionally renaming the image with a provided name.
**parameters**:
· self: A reference to the current instance of the class.
· args: Optional arguments passed to the function. If a non-empty string is provided, it will be used as the filename for the image.

**Code Description**: 
The `cmd_paste` method checks if there is an image in the clipboard first. If an image is found:
1. It extracts the image and determines whether a custom name was provided via the `args` parameter.
2. If a custom name is given, it uses this name with appropriate file extension handling (PNG or JPEG). If no extension is provided, ".png" is appended.
3. A temporary directory is created to save the image temporarily.
4. The image is saved in the determined format and path.
5. It checks if there's an existing file with the same name in the chat; if so, it replaces the old one and logs this action.
6. If no image exists, it adds the new file to the list of added files and notifies the user.

If no image is found, `cmd_paste` attempts to retrieve text from the clipboard:
1. It retrieves the text using the `pyperclip.paste()` method.
2. If any text is retrieved, it outputs the text to the chat interface via `self.io.tool_output()`.
3. The function returns this text.

If neither an image nor text can be found in the clipboard, it logs an error message indicating that no content was found using `self.io.tool_error()`.

In case of any exceptions during processing, it catches them and logs the error to the chat interface with a detailed error message.
**Note**: Ensure that `ImageGrab` and `pyperclip` are correctly installed in your environment. The method relies on these libraries for clipboard operations.
**Output Example**: 
```
Added clipboard image to the chat: /path/to/temp/image.png
```

### FunctionDef _add_read_only_file(self, abs_path, original_name)
**_add_read_only_file**: The function of _add_read_only_file is to add files to the read-only list in the chat if they are not already present or if they need to be moved from the editable list.
**parameters**: 
· abs_path: A string representing the absolute path of the file to be added.
· original_name: A string representing the name of the file as it appears originally.

**Code Description**: The `_add_read_only_file` function is called by `cmd_read_only`, which processes user input to add files or directories to the chat with read-only status. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Image File Check**: If the provided `original_name` indicates an image file and the main model does not support editing images, the function returns without adding the file.
2. **File Existence Validation**: The function first checks if the given path exists using `os.path.isfile`. If it is a directory or non-existent file, an error message is displayed.
3. **Image Extension Check**: It uses the `is_image_file` utility function to verify if the file has an image extension. This check ensures that only relevant files are considered for read-only status.
4. **Absolute Path Conversion**: The function converts relative paths to absolute paths using `self.coder.abs_root_path(path)`.
5. **Editability Check and Addition**:
   - If the file is not already in the read-only list, it is added by calling `_add_read_only_file`.
   - If the file is in the editable list but needs to be moved to the read-only list, it is moved accordingly.

The function interacts with other parts of the system through methods such as `cmd_read_only` and `is_image_file`, ensuring that only appropriate files are added to the read-only status. This helps maintain a clean and organized chat environment where users can reference important documents without modifying them.

**Note**: Ensure that the `IMAGE_EXTENSIONS` list is properly defined elsewhere in the codebase, as it is used by the `is_image_file` function to determine if a file is an image. Also, make sure that the `self.coder.abs_root_path(path)` method correctly handles path conversions based on the project's structure.

**Output Example**: The function does not return any value but modifies the internal state of the system by adding files to the read-only list or moving them from the editable list if necessary. An example interaction might look like this:

```plaintext
Adding file: /path/to/image.jpg (Marked as read-only)
File added successfully.
```

This output indicates that the function has processed and marked a specific file for read-only status, reflecting its role in managing the chat's content.
***
### FunctionDef _add_read_only_directory(self, abs_path, original_name)
**_add_read_only_directory**: The function of _add_read_only_directory is to add files from a given directory to the read-only files list.
**Parameters**:
· parameter1: abs_path (str) - The absolute path of the directory to be processed.
· parameter2: original_name (str) - The name of the directory as originally provided.

**Code Description**: 
The function `_add_read_only_directory` is responsible for adding read-only files from a specified directory to the list of read-only files. It uses `os.walk` to traverse the directory tree rooted at `abs_path`. For each file found, it checks whether the file path is not already in either `self.coder.abs_fnames` (regular files) or `self.coder.abs_read_only_fnames` (existing read-only files). If the file path meets this condition, it adds the file to `self.coder.abs_read_only_fnames` and increments the counter `added_files`. After processing all files in the directory tree, if any new files were added, it outputs a message indicating how many files were added. Otherwise, it indicates that no new files were added.

This function is called by `_add_read_only_file` and `_add_read_only_directory` methods within the `cmd_read_only` command of the `Commands` class. Specifically, when processing directory arguments passed to the `cmd_read_only` method, if a path is a directory, it calls this function to add all files in that directory to the read-only list.

**Note**: Ensure that the paths provided are valid and accessible; otherwise, the function may fail or produce unexpected results. Additionally, be mindful of the performance implications when dealing with large directories as `os.walk` can be resource-intensive.
***
### FunctionDef cmd_map(self, args)
**cmd_map**: The function of cmd_map is to print out the current repository map.
**parameters**:
· args: This parameter is expected to be an instance or a reference that contains necessary arguments for the command execution.

**Code Description**: 
The `cmd_map` method within the `Commands` class serves to display the current state of the repository map. Here’s a detailed analysis:

1. **Initialization and Repository Map Retrieval**: The method starts by calling `self.coder.get_repo_map()`, where `self.coder` is presumably an instance or reference to another object responsible for handling coding-related operations, including managing repository maps.

2. **Conditional Output Based on Availability of Repository Map**:
   - If the retrieved `repo_map` is not empty (i.e., it exists and contains data), the method proceeds to output this map using `self.io.tool_output(repo_map)`. Here, `self.io` likely refers to an interface or utility for handling I/O operations. The `tool_output` method is expected to display the repository map in a readable format.
   - If no repository map is available (i.e., `repo_map` is empty), the method outputs a message indicating that "No repository map available." This serves as a clear indication when there is no relevant data to show.

3. **Error Handling and User Feedback**: The method handles both scenarios—when a repository map exists, and when it does not—with appropriate feedback. This ensures that users receive meaningful information based on the current state of the system or application.

**Note**: Ensure that `self.coder` is properly initialized with an instance capable of returning a valid repository map before calling this method. Additionally, verify that `self.io.tool_output` is correctly implemented to handle and display the output appropriately.
***
### FunctionDef cmd_map_refresh(self, args)
**cmd_map_refresh**: The function of cmd_map_refresh is to force a refresh of the repository map.
**parameters**: 
· self: The instance of the class that contains this method.
· args: Additional arguments passed to the command, though they are not used in this specific implementation.

**Code Description**: This function serves to update or refresh the internal representation of the repository map. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Initialization and Method Call**:
   - The function begins by calling `self.coder.get_repo_map(force_refresh=True)`. This method call forces an immediate refresh of the repository map, bypassing any cached data.
   
2. **Conditional Check**:
   - After the refresh, the code checks if a valid `repo_map` was returned from the `get_repo_map` method. If the `repo_map` is not empty or `None`, it proceeds to output a message indicating that the repository map has been refreshed.

3. **Output Message**:
   - The function then calls `self.io.tool_output("The repo map has been refreshed, use /map to view it.")` to inform the user that the repository map has been updated and provides guidance on how to access the new data using another command (`/map`).

4. **Use Cases**:
   - This method is typically invoked when the system needs to ensure that the latest state of the repository is being used, possibly after a significant change or update.

5. **Implications**:
   - Refreshing the repository map can have implications for subsequent operations that rely on this data. Ensuring it is up-to-date is crucial for maintaining the integrity and accuracy of any analysis or actions performed based on the repository information.

6. **Dependencies**:
   - The function relies on `self.coder.get_repo_map` to perform the actual refresh operation, indicating that the class containing `cmd_map_refresh` must have a method named `get_repo_map` with appropriate functionality.
   - It also depends on `self.io.tool_output` for user notifications, suggesting that the object has an interface or method for outputting tool-specific messages.

**Note**: Ensure that the `force_refresh=True` parameter is passed to `get_repo_map` to guarantee a fresh update. Also, verify that the `io` object and its `tool_output` method are properly configured to handle output in your specific application environment.
***
### FunctionDef cmd_settings(self, args)
**cmd_settings**: The function of `cmd_settings` is to print out the current settings.
**Parameters**:
· args: Command-line arguments passed to the command.

**Code Description**: 
The `cmd_settings` method retrieves and formats the current settings for display, then outputs them along with any announcements. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Retrieve Settings**: The method first calls `format_settings(self.parser, self.args)`. This function takes the parser object and the arguments provided to generate a formatted string representing the current settings. The `self.parser` likely contains configuration options for the command-line interface (CLI), while `self.args` holds user-provided arguments.

2. **Retrieve Announcements**: It then calls `announcements = "\n".join(self.coder.get_announcements())`. This line concatenates any announcements (likely informational or warning messages) retrieved from the `self.coder` object, separated by newlines for better readability.

3. **Construct Output String**: The method constructs an output string combining the announcements and settings using f-string formatting: 
   ```python
   output = f"{announcements}\n{settings}"
   ```
   This ensures that any announcements are displayed first, followed by the formatted settings.

4. **Display Output**: Finally, `self.io.tool_output(output)` is called to display the constructed string in a tool-specific manner (e.g., console output or a GUI window). The `self.io` object likely handles I/O operations for the command.

**Note**: Ensure that the `format_settings`, `get_announcements`, and `tool_output` methods are correctly implemented and available within your codebase. Any issues with these callees can affect the functionality of `cmd_settings`.
***
### FunctionDef completions_raw_load(self, document, complete_event)
**completions_raw_load**: The function of completions_raw_load is to delegate the task of generating file name completions based on user input.

**Parameters**:
· parameter1: `document` - A document object containing information about the current text buffer and cursor position.
· parameter2: `complete_event` - An event object that provides context for completion operations, such as whether a specific key has been pressed.

**Code Description**: The function `completions_raw_load` serves to generate file name completions based on user input. It does this by calling another method, `completions_raw_read_only`, which processes the user's text and generates appropriate completions. Here is a detailed breakdown of its operations:

1. **Delegation to Another Method**: The function `completions_raw_load` simply calls `self.completions_raw_read_only(document, complete_event)`. This method handles the actual logic for generating file name completions.

2. **Contextual Information**: By passing the `document` and `complete_event` objects as parameters, `completions_raw_load` ensures that the completion operation has access to necessary contextual information such as the current text buffer state and any key presses that might affect the completion process.

3. **Consistent Behavior Across Scenarios**: This approach allows for a consistent method of generating file name completions across different command scenarios while maintaining flexibility in handling specific user inputs through `completions_raw_read_only`.

**Note**: Ensure that the `coder` object has been properly initialized and contains valid data for methods like `get_all_relative_files()` and `get_inchat_relative_files()`. The function assumes these methods return sets of file names.

**Output Example**: If the current directory contains files named "example.txt", "test file.txt", and "script.py", and "test file.txt" is already in the chat history, the returned list would be `["\"test file.txt\"", "example.txt", "script.py"]`.

### FunctionDef completions_raw_save(self, document, complete_event)
**completions_raw_save**: The function of completions_raw_save is to return file name completions based on user input.

**Parameters**:
· parameter1: `document` - A document object containing information about the current text buffer and cursor position.
· parameter2: `complete_event` - An event object that provides context for completion operations, such as whether a specific key has been pressed.

**Code Description**: The function `completions_raw_save` simply delegates the task of generating file name completions to another method called `completions_raw_read_only`. This method is responsible for extracting user input, filtering relevant files based on chat history, and formatting these files before returning them as possible completions. By calling `completions_raw_read_only`, `completions_raw_save` ensures a consistent approach across different command scenarios while maintaining flexibility in handling specific user inputs.

**Note**: The function assumes that the `completions_raw_read_only` method has been properly implemented and handles the necessary file operations correctly. Additionally, ensure that the coder object is initialized with valid data for methods such as `get_all_relative_files()` and `get_inchat_relative_files()`.

**Output Example**: If the current directory contains files named "example.txt", "test file.txt", and "script.py", and "test file.txt" is already in the chat history, the returned list would be `["\"test file.txt\"", "example.txt", "script.py"]`.

### FunctionDef cmd_copy(self, args)
**cmd_copy**: The function of `cmd_copy` is to copy the last assistant message from the chat history to the clipboard.
**parameters**:
· self: An instance of the `Commands` class.
· args: Command-line arguments, in this case, an empty string as no specific arguments are required.

**Code Description**:
The `cmd_copy` function performs the following steps:

1. **Retrieve Messages**: It first retrieves all messages from both `done_messages` and `cur_messages`, then filters out only those with the "assistant" role.
2. **Check for Assistant Messages**: If no assistant messages are found, it displays an error message indicating that there are no assistant messages to copy.
3. **Copy Last Assistant Message**: It copies the content of the last assistant message (which is the first in the reversed list) to the clipboard using `pyperclip.copy`.
4. **Preview Output**: If the copied message exceeds 50 characters, it displays a preview of the message along with an "..." at the end.
5. **Error Handling**: It handles potential errors such as `pyperclip.PyperclipException` and other unexpected exceptions by displaying appropriate error messages.

The function ensures that users can easily access the last assistant message for further use or reference, while providing clear feedback through both successful and error scenarios.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the `pyperclip` library is installed to avoid runtime errors.
- The function relies on the `InputOutput` instance to display messages to the user, so any customizations in this class will affect the output behavior.

**Output Example**: 
If the last assistant message was "This is a long-assistant message that needs to be copied", the function would copy it to the clipboard and then print: 
```
Copied last assistant message to clipboard. Preview: This is a long-assistant mess...
```
***
### FunctionDef cmd_report(self, args)
**cmd_report**: The function of cmd_report is to report a problem by opening a GitHub Issue.
**Parameters**:
· self: The instance of the class on which the method is called.
· args: A string containing additional information or a title for the issue.

**Code Description**:
The `cmd_report` method serves as an entry point for users to report issues directly from their coding environment by opening a GitHub Issue. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization and Data Collection**: 
   - The method first imports the `report_github_issue` function from the `aider.report` module.
   - It then collects announcements made by the coder, concatenating them into a single string (`issue_text`). Announcements are likely relevant messages or logs that should be included in the issue.

2. **Title Handling**:
   - The method checks if a title is provided via the `args` parameter. If no title is given, it defaults to "Bug report".

3. **System Information Gathering**:
   - The method retrieves and appends system information such as Aider version, Python version, platform details, and additional runtime information to the `issue_text`. This ensures that the issue report includes crucial context about the environment in which the problem occurred.

4. **Confirmation Prompt (Optional)**:
   - If a confirmation prompt is enabled (`confirm` parameter defaults to `True`), the method displays the collected system information and the issue text, prompting the user for confirmation before opening the browser.
   - The user can choose to open the GitHub Issue or cancel the operation.

5. **Opening the Browser**:
   - If the user confirms, the method constructs a URL with the necessary parameters (including the body of the issue) and attempts to open it in the default web browser using `webbrowser.open`.
   - If opening the browser fails, the method provides an alternative by printing the URL for manual entry.

6. **Error Handling**:
   - The method includes basic error handling by catching exceptions that might occur during the attempt to open the URL.

The interaction with `report_github_issue` is significant as it encapsulates the logic of opening a GitHub Issue, abstracting away the complexities of constructing and submitting the issue. This separation allows for cleaner code in `cmd_report`, focusing on collecting relevant information rather than handling HTTP requests or browser behavior directly.

**Note**: Ensure that the user has internet access and appropriate permissions to open web browsers. Additionally, the system must have a default web browser configured properly to avoid issues during the URL opening process.
***
## FunctionDef expand_subdir(file_path)
**expand_subdir**: The function of expand_subdir is to recursively yield all files within a given directory or return the file itself if it's not a directory.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: file_path (Path) - A path-like object representing either a file or a directory.

**Code Description**: 
The `expand_subdir` function takes a single argument, `file_path`, which is expected to be a valid path-like object. The function first checks if the provided `file_path` is a file using `is_file()`. If it is a file, the function immediately yields this file and returns without further processing.

If the `file_path` is not a file (i.e., it's a directory), the function proceeds to check if it is indeed a directory using `is_dir()`. If so, it uses `rglob("*")` to recursively find all files within this directory. For each found file, it checks whether the file is a regular file (`is_file()`). If it is, the file path is yielded.

This function plays a crucial role in the broader context of the project, specifically within the `glob_filtered_to_repo` method of the `Commands` class. The `glob_filtered_to_repo` method first attempts to match patterns against files and directories, then calls `expand_subdir` on each matched file or directory to ensure that all relevant files are included in the final list.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the input path is valid (either a file or a directory).
- The function uses `rglob("*")`, which can be resource-intensive for large directories, so use it judiciously.
- Be aware of potential issues with very deep directory structures, as this could lead to performance degradation.

**Output Example**: 
If the input `file_path` is `/path/to/directory/subdir/file.txt`, and there are no subdirectories in `/path/to/directory/subdir`, the output will be a generator yielding a single Path object pointing to `/path/to/directory/subdir/file.txt`. If there are subdirectories, such as `/path/to/directory/subdir/another_subdir/another_file.txt`, the output will include both `file.txt` and `another_file.txt` as separate Path objects.
## FunctionDef parse_quoted_filenames(args)
**parse_quoted_filenames**: The function of parse_quoted_filenames is to extract filenames from command-line arguments that may include quoted strings.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: args (str) - A string containing command-line arguments where filenames are passed.

**Code Description**: This function utilizes regular expressions to identify and separate filenames enclosed in quotes or standalone within the provided argument string. It processes these filenames, ensuring they are not empty before returning a list of valid filenames.
- The `re.findall` method is used with a regex pattern that matches filenames enclosed in double quotes (`"(.+?)"`), as well as standalone filenames (`(\S+)`). This allows for the extraction of quoted and unquoted filenames from the input string.
- A list comprehension iterates over the matched results, filtering out any empty strings to ensure only valid filenames are included in the final output. The filtered list is then returned.

This function plays a crucial role in various command-line interface (CLI) operations within the project. For instance:
- In `cmd_read_only`, it helps identify files and directories that should be added to the read-only list, ensuring that paths specified by users are correctly processed.
- Similarly, in `cmd_read_only` and `cmd_read_only`, it extracts filenames from user inputs, allowing for flexible command-line usage where filenames can be quoted or not.

**Note**: Ensure that the input string is properly formatted. If the argument string contains incorrect formatting (e.g., unbalanced quotes), this function may return unexpected results.
**Output Example**: 
If `args = 'file1.txt "file2.txt" file3.txt'`, then `parse_quoted_filenames(args)` would return `['file1.txt', 'file2.txt', 'file3.txt']`.
## FunctionDef get_help_md
### Object: `UserAuthentication`

#### Overview

The `UserAuthentication` class is responsible for managing user authentication processes within the application. It ensures secure and efficient login and registration functionalities by validating user credentials against a database or external service.

#### Properties

- **username**: A string representing the unique username of the user.
- **password**: A string containing the hashed password stored in the system (for security reasons, this is not used for direct comparison during authentication).
- **isAuthenticated**: A boolean value indicating whether the current user session is authenticated or not.

#### Methods

1. **authenticateUser(username: String, password: String): Boolean**
   - **Description**: Authenticates a user by validating their username and hashed password against stored credentials.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `username`: The username of the user attempting to log in.
     - `password`: The plain-text password provided by the user for authentication.
   - **Returns**: A boolean value indicating whether the user was successfully authenticated.

2. **registerUser(username: String, password: String): Boolean**
   - **Description**: Registers a new user by storing their username and hashed password in the system database.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `username`: The unique username for the new user.
     - `password`: The plain-text password provided by the new user.
   - **Returns**: A boolean value indicating whether the registration was successful.

3. **logoutUser(): Boolean**
   - **Description**: Logs out the current authenticated user, invalidating their session and setting `isAuthenticated` to false.
   - **Parameters**: None
   - **Returns**: A boolean value indicating whether the logout process was successful.

4. **checkAuthenticationStatus(): Boolean**
   - **Description**: Checks if the current user session is authenticated.
   - **Parameters**: None
   - **Returns**: The current state of `isAuthenticated`.

#### Example Usage

```java
// Instantiate UserAuthentication object
UserAuthentication auth = new UserAuthentication();

// Register a new user
boolean registrationResult = auth.registerUser("john_doe", "securepassword123");

if (registrationResult) {
    System.out.println("Registration successful.");
}

// Attempt to authenticate the user
boolean authenticationResult = auth.authenticateUser("john_doe", "securepassword123");

if (authenticationResult) {
    System.out.println("Authentication successful.");
} else {
    System.out.println("Authentication failed.");
}

// Log out the user
auth.logoutUser();
```

#### Notes

- The `password` parameter in both `authenticateUser` and `registerUser` methods should be hashed before being passed to these functions. This is a best practice for security.
- Ensure that all database operations are performed securely, especially when handling sensitive information like passwords.

By following the guidelines above, you can effectively manage user authentication within your application using the `UserAuthentication` class.
## FunctionDef main
**main**: The function of main is to print out help information.
**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The `main` function serves as the entry point or starting point of the script, responsible for fetching and printing help information. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Call**: The `main` function is defined without taking any parameters.
2. **Helper Function Invocation**: It calls another function named `get_help_md()`. This function fetches the help information in Markdown format from an instance of the `Commands` class, passing `None` as both arguments to this hypothetical constructor or method.
3. **Markdown Retrieval**: The `get_help_md()` function returns a string containing the help information formatted in Markdown (`md`). This string is then stored in the local variable `md`.
4. **Print Statement**: Finally, the `print(md)` statement outputs the help information to the console.

**Relationship with Callees**: 
- The `main` function relies on the `get_help_md()` function to fetch the necessary data (help information). This ensures that the main function remains concise and focused solely on printing the output.
- The `get_help_md()` function, in turn, likely handles the complex logic of generating or retrieving help information from a source such as a database or configuration file.

**Note**: Ensure that the `Commands` class is properly configured to provide accurate and up-to-date help information. Any issues with the `Commands` instance or its methods could result in incorrect output when running the `main` function.

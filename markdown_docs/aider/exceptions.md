## ClassDef ExInfo
**ExInfo**: The function of ExInfo is to encapsulate information about an exception, including its name, whether it can be retried, and a description.

**attributes**: 
· name: A string representing the name of the exception.
· retry: A boolean indicating whether the exception allows for retries.
· description: A string providing additional details about the exception.

**Code Description**: The `ExInfo` class is designed to store metadata related to exceptions. It has three attributes: `name`, which holds a descriptive name for the exception; `retry`, which indicates if an attempt can be made after the exception occurs; and `description`, which provides more context or details about what caused the exception.

In the project, the `ExInfo` class is used within the `LiteLLMExceptions` class to handle different types of exceptions. Specifically:
- The `get_ex_info` method in `LiteLLMExceptions` retrieves an instance of `ExInfo` for a given exception type.
  - If the exception type is known and registered, it returns an appropriate `ExInfo` object with relevant details (e.g., name and description).
  - If the exception type is unknown or not registered, it defaults to returning an `ExInfo` object with placeholder values (`None` for all attributes).

The test cases in `test_get_ex_info` demonstrate how this functionality works:
- For a known exception type like `AuthenticationError`, the method correctly returns an `ExInfo` instance containing relevant details.
- For an unknown exception type, it appropriately returns an `ExInfo` instance with placeholder values.

This design allows for flexible handling of various exceptions while maintaining clear and structured metadata about each one.

### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the LiteLLMExceptions instance by loading exceptions from the `litellm` module.
**parameters**: This method does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` method in the `LiteLLMExceptions` class serves as the constructor for initializing an instance of this class. It internally calls another method, `_load`, to load exceptions from the `litellm` module into the current instance's `exceptions` dictionary.

1. **Initialization and Call**: The `__init__` method is called when a new instance of `LiteLLMExceptions` is created.
2. **Loading Exceptions**:
   - It imports the `litellm` module, which contains various exception classes.
   - `_load` iterates through all attributes in the `litellm` module using `dir(litellm)`.
   - For each attribute that ends with "Error", it checks if this exception is listed in the `EXCEPTIONS` list. The `EXCEPTIONS` list contains predefined exceptions managed by the `aider` project.
   - If a strict mode (`strict=True`) is enabled and an exception from `litellm` is not found in the `EXCEPTIONS` list, it raises a `ValueError`.
   - For each valid exception, `_load` retrieves its class using `getattr(litellm, var)` and stores it in the `exceptions` dictionary of the current instance. If an additional information object (`ex_info`) is available for this exception, it also gets stored.

This ensures that all relevant exceptions from the `litellm` module are loaded into the `LiteLLMExceptions` class, allowing for centralized error handling and management within the `aider` project.

**Note**: 
- Ensure the `EXCEPTIONS` list is updated whenever new exceptions are added to the `litellm` module.
- When setting `strict=True`, it helps catch potential issues by ensuring all necessary exceptions are defined in the `aider's` exceptions list.
***
### FunctionDef _load(self, strict)
**_load**: The function of _load is to load exceptions from the `litellm` module into the `LiteLLMExceptions` class.

**parameters**: 
· parameter1: strict (default value: False)
    - A boolean flag indicating whether to raise an error if an exception from `litellm` is not found in `aider's` exceptions list. When set to True, it ensures that all exceptions defined in `litellm` are explicitly listed in the `EXCEPTIONS` list.

**Code Description**: 
The `_load` function iterates through the attributes of the `litellm` module and checks if each attribute ends with "Error". For those that do, it further checks whether the exception is present in the `EXCEPTIONS` list. If a strict check is enabled (i.e., `strict=True`) and an exception from `litellm` is not found in `aider's` exceptions list, a `ValueError` is raised.

The function then retrieves the actual exception class using `getattr(litellm, var)` and assigns it to the `exceptions` dictionary of the `LiteLLMExceptions` instance. If an exception from `litellm` has a corresponding entry in the `EXCEPTIONS` list, additional information about this exception is stored.

This function plays a critical role in ensuring that all exceptions defined in the `litellm` library are accounted for and properly handled within the `LiteLLMExceptions` class. By loading these exceptions into the class, it allows for centralized management of error handling mechanisms, making the code more robust and maintainable.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `EXCEPTIONS` list is updated whenever new exceptions are added to the `litellm` module.
- When calling `_load`, setting `strict=True` can help catch potential issues early by ensuring all necessary exceptions are defined in `aider's` exceptions list.
***
### FunctionDef exceptions_tuple(self)
**exceptions_tuple**: The function of exceptions_tuple is to return a tuple containing all the exceptions defined within LiteLLMExceptions.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The `exceptions_tuple` method returns a tuple that contains all the exception classes defined within the `LiteLLMExceptions` class. This method is used in various contexts where it is necessary to handle multiple types of exceptions, such as during retries or error handling processes. The returned tuple allows for more flexible and comprehensive exception management.

In the context of the project, this function is called by several components:
- In `sendchat.py`, specifically within the `simple_send_with_retries` function, it is used to catch and handle multiple types of exceptions that may occur during a chat message send operation. The tuple returned from `exceptions_tuple()` helps in identifying and managing different kinds of errors.
- In `basic/test_exceptions.py`, the test function `test_exceptions_tuple` verifies that `exceptions_tuple()` returns a non-empty tuple, ensuring that all defined exceptions are properly documented and can be handled.

This method ensures that any exception related to LiteLLMExceptions can be caught and processed appropriately. The returned tuple is crucial for robust error handling in asynchronous operations or retry mechanisms where multiple types of errors need to be managed.

**Note**: Ensure that the `LiteLLMExceptions` class contains all necessary exception definitions before calling `exceptions_tuple()`. This method should be called only when it is certain that the exceptions are defined and relevant to the current context.

**Output Example**: 
```python
# Possible output of exceptions_tuple()
('ConnectionError', 'TimeoutError', 'RateLimitError')
```
This example shows a tuple containing three different exception classes, which would allow for comprehensive error handling in various scenarios.

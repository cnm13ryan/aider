## ClassDef LazyLiteLLM
**LazyLiteLLM**: The function of LazyLiteLLM is to provide a lazy-loaded interface for the `litellm` module.

**Attributes**:
· `_lazy_module`: A private attribute that holds an instance of the `litellm` module, which is loaded lazily on first access.

**Code Description**: 
The `LazyLiteLLM` class in this code snippet provides a lazy-loading mechanism for the `litellm` module. This means that the module is not imported and initialized until it is actually needed, reducing initial overhead and potentially improving performance.

1. **Initialization and Lazy Loading Mechanism**:
   - The class has an instance variable `_lazy_module`, which is set to `None` by default.
   - The `__getattr__` method handles attribute access for any non-existent attributes. If the requested attribute is `_lazy_module`, it returns `super()`. This is a placeholder and will be replaced with the actual value of `_lazy_module`.
   - For all other attributes, the class attempts to load the `litellm` module if it hasn't been loaded yet by calling `_load_litellm()`.

2. **Module Loading**:
   - The `_load_litellm` method checks if `_lazy_module` is already set. If not, it imports the `litellm` module using `importlib.import_module`.
   - Once imported, various settings are configured for the `litellm` module to suppress debug information (`suppress_debug_info = True`), disable verbose logging (`set_verbose = False`), and drop unused parameters (`drop_params = True`).
   - The `_logging._disable_debugging()` method is called to ensure that no debugging logs are generated, further enhancing performance.

3. **Lazy Loading Process**:
   - When any attribute of `LazyLiteLLM` is accessed (except for `_lazy_module`), the class first checks if `_lazy_module` has been loaded.
   - If it hasn't been loaded yet, `_load_litellm()` is called to import and configure the `litellm` module.
   - Once the module is loaded, the requested attribute from `litellm` is returned.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `litellm` module is available in your environment. If it's not present, the class will raise an `ImportError`.
- The configuration settings for `litellm` (such as disabling debug information and verbose logging) can be adjusted according to specific requirements.
- The lazy loading mechanism ensures that resources are only allocated when necessary, which can be beneficial in large-scale applications where multiple modules might not all be needed simultaneously.

**Output Example**: 
```python
# Example usage
lazy_llm = LazyLiteLLM()
response = lazy_llm.create_chat_completion(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}])
print(response)
```

In this example, `create_chat_completion` is a method of the `litellm` module accessed via the `LazyLiteLLM` instance `lazy_llm`. The `litellm` module is lazily loaded and configured before the method call.
### FunctionDef __getattr__(self, name)
**__getattr__**: The function of __getattr__ is to handle attribute access for attributes not found on the instance.
**Parameters**: 
· name: The name of the attribute being accessed.

**Code Description**: The `__getattr__` method is designed to handle attempts to access an attribute that does not exist on the instance. If the attribute `_lazy_module` is requested, it returns the super class's context using `super()`. For other attributes, it first loads the `litellm` module if it hasn't been loaded yet through `_load_litellm()` and then delegates the attribute access to this module.

1. **Condition for Returning Super Class**: If the attribute being accessed is `_lazy_module`, the method returns the super class's context using `super()`. This ensures that any missing attributes are looked up in the superclass, which could be useful if `LazyLiteLLM` inherits from another class where these attributes might exist.

2. **Loading Lazy Module**: If the attribute is not `_lazy_module`, the method checks whether the `_lazy_module` has been loaded by calling `_load_litellm()`. This function ensures that the `litellm` module is imported and configured with specific settings, such as suppressing debug information and setting verbose mode to false.

3. **Delegating Attribute Access**: After loading the lazy module if necessary, the method uses `getattr(self._lazy_module, name)` to access the attribute on the `_lazy_module`. This allows attributes of the `litellm` module to be accessed directly through instances of `LazyLiteLLM`.

**Note**: The use of `__getattr__` ensures that any missing attributes are handled gracefully by either returning super class context or loading and delegating to the lazy-loaded module. This is particularly useful in scenarios where dynamic attribute access needs to be managed, such as when interfacing with external libraries or dynamically loaded modules.

**Output Example**: If an instance of `LazyLiteLLM` has `_lazy_module` set, accessing its attributes will return values from the `litellm` module. For example:
```python
llm_instance = LazyLiteLLM()
print(llm_instance.some_attribute)  # This would call getattr on llm_instance._lazy_module if it exists.
```

This method ensures that any attribute not found in the instance itself is handled by either returning super class context or dynamically loading and accessing attributes from the `litellm` module.

## FunctionDef send_completion(model_name, messages, functions, stream, temperature, extra_params)
**send_completion**: The function of send_completion is to initiate a completion request using the specified model and messages.

**parameters**:
· model_name: The name of the model to use for generating the response.
· messages: A list of messages to be sent to the model, formatted as required by the API.
· functions: An optional list of functions that can be called during the chat session. Each function is a dictionary containing its type and parameters.
· stream: A boolean indicating whether the response should be streamed or not.
· temperature: An optional parameter controlling the randomness of the generated text. Default value is 0, which means no randomness.
· extra_params: Additional parameters to pass along with the request.

**Code Description**: The send_completion function is a utility for sending completion requests to a language model using the LiteLLM API. It constructs the necessary arguments based on the input parameters and sends the request via the `litellm.completion` method. Here’s a detailed analysis:

1. **Initialization of kwargs**: A dictionary named `kwargs` is initialized with basic parameters such as `model`, `messages`, and `stream`. These are essential for any completion request.
2. **Temperature Handling**: If a non-zero temperature value is provided, it updates the `kwargs` to include this parameter, affecting the randomness of the generated text.
3. **Function Handling**: If functions are specified, they are added to the `kwargs` as both tools and tool choices. This ensures that any callable functions can be invoked during the chat session.
4. **Extra Parameters**: Any additional parameters provided via `extra_params` are merged into the `kwargs`, allowing for flexible customization of the request.
5. **Hash Generation**: The function generates a SHA1 hash of the constructed arguments to ensure idempotency and caching purposes, storing it in `hash_object`.
6. **Caching Mechanism**: If caching is enabled (`CACHE` is not None) and the key already exists in `CACHE`, the cached response is returned directly.
7. **Request Sending**: The function sends the completion request using `litellm.completion(**kwargs)`. Depending on whether streaming is enabled, it either processes the streamed response or waits for the full response.
8. **Caching Response**: If caching is enabled and no cache hit occurred, the response is stored in `CACHE` under the generated key.

The function integrates seamlessly with other parts of the project by providing a standardized way to interact with language models while offering flexibility through optional parameters like functions and extra parameters.

**Note**: Ensure that the `CACHE` dictionary is properly initialized before calling this function. Also, handle exceptions appropriately as network requests can fail for various reasons.

**Output Example**: The function returns a tuple where the first element is a SHA1 hash object representing the request, and the second element is the response from the model. For example:
```
(hash_object, {'choices': [{'text': 'Hello, how can I assist you today?'}], 'usage': {...}})
```

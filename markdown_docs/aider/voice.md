## ClassDef SoundDeviceError
**SoundDeviceError**: The function of SoundDeviceError is to handle exceptions related to sound device issues.
**attributes**: This class does not define any attributes other than inheriting from the base Exception class.

**Code Description**: 
The `SoundDeviceError` class is a custom exception derived from Python's built-in `Exception` class. It serves as a placeholder for handling specific errors that may arise when interfacing with sound devices, such as issues importing necessary libraries or accessing audio input devices. This class is used in the `Voice` class to indicate problems related to sound device operations.

In the `Voice` class constructor (`__init__`), if the `sounddevice` library cannot be imported due to missing dependencies like `portaudio`, a `SoundDeviceError` is raised. Similarly, during the initialization process, if an error occurs while querying or accessing the audio input device (e.g., due to a `PortAudioError`), another `SoundDeviceError` is thrown.

The `Voice` class also uses `SoundDeviceError` in its methods such as `record_and_transcribe` and `raw_record_and_transcribe`. In these methods, if an error related to the sound device occurs (e.g., during recording or transcription), a `SoundDeviceError` is raised with appropriate messages indicating the nature of the issue.

The `cmd_voice` method in the `Commands` class calls `voice.Voice()` and handles potential `SoundDeviceError` exceptions. If such an error is encountered, it prints a user-friendly message suggesting that the user checks their audio settings and tries again.

**Note**: Ensure that necessary dependencies like `sounddevice`, `soundfile`, and `portaudio` are installed before using this class to avoid `SoundDeviceError`. Also, verify that your system has a working audio input device connected.
## ClassDef Voice
**Voice**: The function of Voice is to initialize and manage audio recording and transcription using the Whisper model.
**Attributes**:
· `max_rms`: Stores the maximum root mean square (RMS) value encountered during recording, used to calculate signal strength.
· `min_rms`: Stores the minimum RMS value encountered during recording, also for calculating signal strength.
· `pct`: A percentage value representing the relative strength of the current audio input compared to the recorded range.
· `threshold`: A threshold value (0.15) used to determine if the audio is strong enough to consider as a meaningful prompt.
· `audio_format`: The format in which the recorded audio will be saved, defaulting to "wav" but can also be "mp3" or "webm".
**Code Description**: 
The Voice class handles the initialization and management of audio recording and transcription. It uses the `sounddevice` library for capturing audio input and `soundfile` for saving audio files temporarily. The class provides methods to initialize the sound device, record audio with a callback function that updates RMS values, generate prompts based on recorded data, and transcribe the recorded audio using the Whisper model.

The constructor (`__init__`) sets up the necessary configurations such as importing required libraries, initializing `sounddevice`, and validating the audio format. The `callback` method is triggered for each block of audio input during recording. It calculates RMS values, updates global minimum and maximum RMS values, and computes a percentage value based on these calculations to determine if the recorded audio is strong enough to consider as a meaningful prompt.

The `get_prompt` method generates a visual progress bar indicating how much of the expected duration has been recorded. The `record_and_transcribe` method handles the actual recording process and transcribes the recorded audio using the Whisper model. It also manages exceptions such as keyboard interrupts and sound device errors, providing appropriate error messages to the user.

The `raw_record_and_transcribe` method is a more detailed version of `record_and_transcribe`, handling the recording and transcription processes step-by-step, including saving temporary audio files in different formats based on the specified audio format parameter. This method ensures that the recorded audio can be saved as "wav", "mp3", or "webm" files.

The class is called by the `cmd` module to enable voice input functionality. The `cmd` module initializes a Voice object, sets up the necessary configurations, and handles user interactions through command history and input prompts. When the user invokes the `/voice` command, the `record_and_transcribe` method of the Voice object is invoked to capture and transcribe audio input.

**Note**: Ensure that all required libraries (`sounddevice`, `soundfile`) are installed before using this class. Additionally, provide an OpenAI API key for successful transcription with Whisper model integration.
**Output Example**: The output would be a string containing the transcribed text from the recorded voice input, such as "Hello, how can I assist you today?" based on the user's spoken input.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, audio_format)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the Voice object by setting up the sound device and configuring audio format settings.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: audio_format (default value: "wav")
- This parameter specifies the desired audio format for recording or playback, with a default value of "wav".

**Code Description**: The `__init__` method in the `Voice` class is responsible for initializing an instance of the Voice object. It first checks if the `sounddevice` library can be imported; if not, it raises a `SoundDeviceError`. If the import is successful, it prints a message indicating that the sound device is being initialized and imports the `sounddevice` module as `sd`.

The method then assigns the imported `sounddevice` module to the instance variable `self.sd`, making it available for subsequent use within the Voice object. It also checks if the provided `audio_format` parameter is supported, raising a `ValueError` if an unsupported format is specified.

This initialization process ensures that the Voice object is properly configured with the necessary libraries and settings before any recording or transcription operations can be performed. The method's handling of potential errors through exceptions helps in gracefully managing situations where the sound device cannot be accessed or the audio format is not supported, providing clear feedback to the user about what went wrong.

**Note**: Ensure that the `sounddevice` library is installed and properly configured on your system before using this class. Additionally, verify that a working audio input device is connected and functioning correctly. The default audio format "wav" can be changed by specifying another supported format like "mp3" or "webm" during object instantiation.

### FunctionDef callback(self, indata, frames, time, status)
**callback**: The function of callback is to process audio data from an audio input device.
**parameters**:
· indata: The raw audio data received from the audio input device.
· frames: The number of audio frames processed.
· time: The timestamp when the audio block was captured.
· status: A flag indicating any issues with the audio input.

**Code Description**: 
The `callback` function is called by the sound device (SD) library to process each audio block from an active audio stream. It is designed to be executed in a separate thread, ensuring that it does not block the main application flow while processing audio data. The primary responsibilities of this function include:

1. **RMS Calculation**: The function calculates the root mean square (RMS) value of the input audio data using NumPy for each frame. RMS is a measure of the magnitude of a varying quantity, which helps in understanding the volume or energy of the sound.

2. **Dynamic Range Tracking**: It tracks the maximum and minimum RMS values over time to determine the dynamic range of the audio signal. This information is crucial for analyzing the variability in sound levels.

3. **Pct Calculation**: The function computes a percentage (`pct`) that represents how much the current RMS value deviates from the minimum RMS value within the observed dynamic range. If the dynamic range is less than 0.001, it sets `pct` to 0.5 as a default.

4. **Queue Management**: The function stores the processed audio data in a queue (`self.q`). This allows for asynchronous processing of audio blocks and ensures that all frames are captured before further processing steps occur.

**Relationship with Callers**:
The `callback` function is called by the `sd.InputStream` object when an audio input stream is active. It plays a critical role in capturing audio data during the recording process, which is managed by the `raw_record_and_transcribe` method. The `raw_record_and_transcribe` method sets up the audio stream and handles the transcription of recorded audio.

**Note**: Ensure that NumPy is imported at the beginning of the file to avoid import errors. Additionally, this function should be robust against potential issues with audio input devices by handling exceptions appropriately, as demonstrated in the caller's error handling section.
***
### FunctionDef get_prompt(self)
**get_prompt**: The function of `get_prompt` is to generate a status update message indicating the recording progress.
**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The function `get_prompt` generates a prompt string that provides feedback on the current state of voice recording. It calculates a progress bar and the elapsed time since the start of the recording.

1. **Initialization and Threshold Check**: The function initializes a variable `num` to 10, which represents the total length of the progress bar. If the value of `self.pct` (a percentage representing recording progress) is either NaN (Not a Number) or less than `self.threshold`, it sets `cnt` to 0. Otherwise, it calculates `cnt` as an integer value proportional to `self.pct`.

2. **Progress Bar Construction**: A progress bar is constructed using the character "█" for completed parts and "░" for remaining parts of the recording. The length of each part is determined by `cnt`. The bar is truncated to a maximum length of 10 characters.

3. **Time Calculation**: The elapsed time since the start of the recording (`self.start_time`) is calculated using `time.time() - self.start_time`.

4. **Prompt String Construction**: Finally, the function returns a formatted string that includes the progress bar and the elapsed time. This message provides users with real-time feedback on their recording session.

The relationship with its callers in the project from a functional perspective: The function `get_prompt` is called within the `raw_record_and_transcribe` method to provide continuous status updates during the voice recording process. These prompts help users understand how much of the recording has been completed and how long they have been recording.

**Note**: Ensure that `self.pct`, `self.threshold`, and `self.start_time` are properly initialized before calling this function, as these variables are used within its logic. Also, make sure that `math.isnan(self.pct)` is imported from the `math` module.
**Output Example**: A possible return value of the function could be: `"Recording, press ENTER when done... 3.2sec ▓"` if the recording has progressed by 30% and has been running for approximately 3.2 seconds.

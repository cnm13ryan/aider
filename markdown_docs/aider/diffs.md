## FunctionDef main
**main**: The function of main is to compare two files line by line and display partial diffs.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters directly but relies on command-line arguments provided when running the script.
· `file_orig`: The original file path.
· `file_updated`: The updated file path.

**Code Description**: 
The function `main` is responsible for comparing two files, where one is considered to be in its original state (`file_orig`) and the other in an updated state (`file_updated`). It ensures that both files are opened correctly with UTF-8 encoding. For each line in the updated file, it uses a helper function `diff_partial_update` to generate a diff between the lines of the original file up to the current point and the corresponding lines from the updated file.

1. **Argument Validation**: The script first checks if exactly two arguments are provided via `sys.argv`. If not, it prints usage instructions and exits with an error status.
2. **File Reading**: It reads all lines from both files into memory as lists (`lines_orig` and `lines_updated`).
3. **Diff Generation Loop**: For each line in the updated file (excluding the last newline character), it calls `diff_partial_update` to generate a diff up to that point.
4. **Progress Bar and Diff Output**: The function `create_progress_bar` is used to create a progress bar indicating how much of the update has been processed. This information is included in the output along with the unified diff generated by `difflib.unified_diff`.
5. **Output Display**: The resulting diff, including any necessary context lines and progress indicators, is printed out.

The helper function `diff_partial_update` is called repeatedly within this loop to handle each segment of the update. This ensures that only the relevant parts of the files are compared at a time, providing a more efficient and manageable output as the update progresses.

**Note**: Ensure that both input files exist before running the script to avoid errors. The script assumes that the updated file is being processed incrementally; hence, it stops processing once it reaches the end of the original file or finds no further changes needed.
## FunctionDef create_progress_bar(percentage)
**create_progress_bar**: The function of create_progress_bar is to generate a progress bar based on a given percentage.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: percentage (int) - The percentage value used to determine the length of the filled part of the progress bar.

**Code Description**: 
The `create_progress_bar` function takes an integer `percentage` as input and generates a visual representation of a progress bar. Here’s how it works:
- It defines two characters, `block` (filled block) and `empty` (empty block).
- The total number of blocks in the progress bar is set to 30.
- Based on the given percentage, it calculates the number of filled blocks (`filled_blocks`) by multiplying the total number of blocks with the percentage and performing integer division by 100.
- It then calculates the number of empty blocks (`empty_blocks`) as the difference between the total blocks and the filled blocks.
- The progress bar is constructed by concatenating the appropriate number of `block` and `empty` characters to form a string that visually represents the given percentage.

The function returns this string, which can be used in other parts of the codebase, such as in the `diff_partial_update` function, where it helps display the progress of file updates during a diff process.

**Note**: The function assumes that the input `percentage` is between 0 and 100 inclusive. Any value outside this range will result in unexpected behavior.

**Output Example**: 
For example, if `percentage = 75`, the output would be:
```
███████████████████░░░░░░
```
This represents a progress bar where 75% is filled with blocks and 25% remains empty.
## FunctionDef assert_newlines(lines)
**assert_newlines**: The function of assert_newlines is to ensure that each line in the input list ends with a newline character.
**Parameters**:
· lines: A list of strings representing lines of text.

**Code Description**:
The `assert_newlines` function checks if each line in the provided list ends with a newline character. If any line does not end with a newline, an assertion error is raised, and the problematic line is reported. This ensures that the input data is properly formatted, which is crucial for operations involving text processing or file handling.

The function performs the following steps:
1. It first checks if the `lines` list is empty. If it is, the function returns immediately without performing any assertions.
2. For each line in the `lines[:-1]` (all lines except the last one), it asserts that the line ends with a newline character (`\n`). The assertion uses an `assert` statement to check if the condition is true; otherwise, it raises an AssertionError and prints the problematic line.

This function is called by the `diff_partial_update` method, which processes partial updates of file content. Ensuring that each line has a trailing newline is important because it maintains consistency in text representation and prevents issues when concatenating or comparing lines of text.

**Note**: This function assumes that the input list contains valid strings representing lines of text. If any element in the `lines` list is not a string, an assertion error will be raised during execution.

**Output Example**: 
If the `lines` parameter is provided as `['line1\n', 'line2', 'line3\n']`, the function will raise an AssertionError because `'line2'` does not end with a newline character. The output might look like:
```
AssertionError: line2
```
## FunctionDef diff_partial_update(lines_orig, lines_updated, final, fname)
### Object: UserAuthenticationService

**Description:**
The `UserAuthenticationService` is a critical component of our application responsible for managing user authentication processes. It ensures secure and efficient user login and session management.

**Responsibilities:**

1. **User Login:** Facilitates the process of users logging into their accounts.
2. **Session Management:** Manages user sessions to maintain state information across multiple requests.
3. **Password Encryption:** Encrypts passwords for storage and comparison during authentication.
4. **Token Generation:** Generates secure tokens (e.g., JWT) to authenticate subsequent API calls.

**Key Methods:**

1. **Login Method**
   - **Purpose:** Authenticates users based on provided credentials.
   - **Parameters:**
     - `username`: The user's unique identifier.
     - `password`: The user's password.
   - **Return Value:** A JSON Web Token (JWT) upon successful authentication, or an error message if the login fails.

2. **Logout Method**
   - **Purpose:** Ends a user’s session by revoking their token.
   - **Parameters:**
     - `token`: The JWT used to authenticate the current session.
   - **Return Value:** A confirmation message indicating that the session has been successfully terminated.

3. **Password Reset Request**
   - **Purpose:** Sends an email with instructions to reset a user's password.
   - **Parameters:**
     - `email`: The user’s registered email address.
   - **Return Value:** Confirmation message sent via email if the request is successful, or an error message if the email does not exist in the system.

4. **Password Reset Method**
   - **Purpose:** Resets a user's password after they have clicked on the reset link from the email.
   - **Parameters:**
     - `resetToken`: The token received via email.
     - `newPassword`: The new password chosen by the user.
   - **Return Value:** Confirmation message indicating that the password has been successfully updated, or an error message if the reset token is invalid.

**Error Handling:**

- **Invalid Credentials:** Returns a 401 Unauthorized status with an appropriate error message.
- **Expired Tokens:** Invalidates and revokes tokens that have expired.
- **Internal Server Errors:** Logs errors and returns a generic 500 Internal Server Error response.

**Security Considerations:**
- All sensitive data, including passwords, are encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms before storage.
- JWTs used for session management are signed with a secret key to prevent tampering and ensure integrity.
- Password reset requests are rate-limited to prevent abuse and ensure user security.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example of logging in a user
response = UserAuthenticationService.login(username="john_doe", password="secure_password123")
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Login successful. Token:", response.json()["token"])
else:
    print("Login failed:", response.text)

# Example of resetting a password
reset_response = UserAuthenticationService.password_reset_request(email="john_doe@example.com")
print(reset_response.text)  # Confirmation message sent via email

new_password_response = UserAuthenticationService.password_reset(token="reset_token", newPassword="new_secure_password123")
if new_password_response.status_code == 200:
    print("Password reset successful.")
else:
    print("Password reset failed:", new_password_response.text)
```

**Dependencies:**
- `crypto`: For password encryption and token signing.
- `email`: For sending password reset emails.

## FunctionDef find_last_non_deleted(lines_orig, lines_updated)
**find_last_non_deleted**: The function of find_last_non_deleted is to determine the index of the last line that was not deleted when comparing two sets of lines.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: `lines_orig` - A list of original lines, which serves as the reference for comparison.
· parameter2: `lines_updated` - A list of updated lines, used to compare against the original lines.

**Code Description**: The function `find_last_non_deleted` aims to identify the last line in `lines_orig` that was not marked as deleted during a comparison with `lines_updated`. It does this by iterating through the differences produced by `difflib.ndiff`, which provides a side-by-side comparison of two sequences. For each line, it checks if the code character (indicating ' ', '+', or '-') is ' '. This indicates that the line exists in both original and updated lists but has not been deleted. The function keeps track of this last non-deleted index and returns it.

The `difflib.ndiff` function generates a sequence of differences, where each difference line starts with one of three characters:
- `' '`: Indicates a matching line between the two sequences.
- `'+'`: Indicates an added line in the updated version.
- `'-'`: Indicates a deleted line from the original version.

The function iterates through these lines and updates `num_orig` (the index of the last non-deleted line) whenever it encounters a line marked with ' '. This ensures that the final value of `last_non_deleted_orig` is the index of the last line in `lines_orig` that was not deleted during the comparison.

This function is called by `diff_partial_update`, which uses its output to determine how much of an updated file has been completed. Specifically, `find_last_non_deleted` helps identify the point up to which the update process has progressed, excluding any lines marked as deleted. This information is crucial for displaying a partial diff that only includes changes made so far.

**Note**: The function assumes that both input lists (`lines_orig` and `lines_updated`) are properly formatted and contain newline characters at appropriate positions. Ensure that the input data meets these requirements to avoid unexpected behavior.

**Output Example**: If `lines_orig = ['line1\n', 'line2\n', 'line3\n']` and `lines_updated = ['line1\n', '+updated line1\n', '-line2\n', 'line3\n']`, then `find_last_non_deleted(lines_orig, lines_updated)` would return 2 because the last non-deleted line is `line3`, which has an index of 2 in the original list.

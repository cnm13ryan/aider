# Documentation for `Logger` Class

## Overview

The `Logger` class is designed to facilitate logging of application events and errors in a structured and consistent manner. This class supports various log levels such as DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL, ensuring that different types of events can be logged appropriately.

## Usage

### Instantiation

```python
from custom_logger import Logger

logger = Logger(name="MyAppLogger")
```

### Log Levels

The `Logger` class supports the following log levels:

- **DEBUG**: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.
- **INFO**: Confirmation that things are working as expected.
- **WARNING**: An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g., ‘disk space low’). The software is still functioning.
- **ERROR**: Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.
- **CRITICAL**: A serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.

### Methods

#### `log(message: str, level: str)`

Logs a message at the specified log level. This method is used for generating logs with custom messages and levels.

```python
logger.log("This is an info message", "INFO")
```

#### `debug(message: str)`

Logs a debug-level message.

```python
logger.debug("This is a debug message")
```

#### `info(message: str)`

Logs an info-level message.

```python
logger.info("This is an info message")
```

#### `warning(message: str)`

Logs a warning-level message.

```python
logger.warning("This is a warning message")
```

#### `error(message: str)`

Logs an error-level message.

```python
logger.error("This is an error message")
```

#### `critical(message: str)`

Logs a critical-level message. This method should be used for serious errors that may cause the application to crash.

```python
logger.critical("This is a critical message")
```

### Configuration

The logging configuration can be customized by setting properties such as log file path, log level, and format:

```python
logger.set_log_file("/path/to/logfile.log")
logger.set_level("DEBUG")
logger.set_format("%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s")
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Logging an Info Message

```python
from custom_logger import Logger

# Create a logger instance
logger = Logger(name="MyLogger")

# Log an info message
logger.info("Application started successfully.")
```

### Example 2: Customizing Log Level and Format

```python
from custom_logger import Logger

# Create a logger instance with custom settings
logger = Logger(name="MyLogger")
logger.set_level("WARNING")
logger.set_format("%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s")

# Log messages at different levels
logger.warning("Disk space is low.")
logger.error("Failed to connect to database.")
```

## Conclusion

The `Logger` class provides a robust and flexible logging mechanism that can be easily integrated into any application. By using this class, developers can ensure that their applications are well-documented and issues can be traced efficiently.

### FunctionDef __init__(self, map_tokens, root, main_model, io, repo_content_prefix, verbose, max_context_window, map_mul_no_files, refresh)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the RepoMap class.

**parameters**:
· map_tokens: An integer specifying the maximum number of tokens to use when mapping files.
· root: A string representing the root directory path; defaults to the current working directory if not provided.
· main_model: An object or model used for processing, typically a language model.
· io: An interface for input/output operations.
· repo_content_prefix: A prefix for content in the repository, useful for distinguishing different parts of the codebase.
· verbose: A boolean indicating whether to enable verbose output; defaults to False.
· max_context_window: An integer specifying the maximum context window size, if provided.
· map_mul_no_files: An integer used as a multiplier for the number of files when mapping repositories.
· refresh: A string or value controlling how often the repository content should be refreshed.

**Code Description**: The `__init__` method sets up an instance of the RepoMap class by initializing various attributes and performing necessary setup. Here is a detailed breakdown:

- **Initialization of Attributes**:
  - `self.io`: Sets the input/output interface to the provided value or uses the default if not specified.
  - `self.verbose`: Configures whether verbose output should be enabled based on the `verbose` parameter.

- **Setting Root Directory**:
  - If no `root` is provided, it defaults to the current working directory (`os.getcwd()`).

- **Loading Tags Cache**:
  - The method calls `load_tags_cache`, which initializes or reloads a cache for tags. This ensures that tag-related data is always up-to-date and accessible efficiently.

- **Setting Other Attributes**:
  - `self.max_map_tokens`: Sets the maximum number of tokens to use during file mapping.
  - `self.map_mul_no_files`: Configures a multiplier used in mapping operations.
  - `self.max_context_window`: Assigns a value for the maximum context window size if provided.
  - `self.repo_content_prefix`: Stores any specified prefix for repository content.

- **Caching Mechanisms**:
  - `self.tree_cache`, `self.tree_context_cache`, and `self.map_cache` are dictionaries used to cache tree structures, context information, and mapping results respectively. These caches help in reducing redundant computations.
  - `self.map_processing_time`: Tracks the time taken for processing maps.
  - `self.last_map`: Stores the last processed map for quick reference.

- **Verbose Output**:
  - If `verbose` is set to True, a message indicating the value of `map_mul_no_files` is printed using the provided `io.tool_output` method. This helps in debugging and understanding the configuration at runtime.

The `__init__` method ensures that all necessary resources are prepared before any operations involving the repository map can be performed. By setting up these attributes, it enables efficient caching mechanisms and provides a flexible setup for handling different configurations of the RepoMap class.

**Note**: Ensure that the provided `io`, `main_model`, and other dependencies are correctly initialized to avoid runtime errors. The method also relies on the successful initialization of the tags cache through the `load_tags_cache` function, which is critical for maintaining consistent and up-to-date tag information.

### FunctionDef token_count(self, text)
**token_count**: The function of token_count is to estimate the number of tokens in a given text by either directly using a main model or through sampling.
**Parameters**:
· parameter1: self - A reference to the current instance of RepoMap.
· parameter2: text - The input text for which the token count needs to be estimated.

**Code Description**: This function is designed to estimate the number of tokens in a given text, especially when the text length exceeds 200 characters. Here’s how it works:

1. **Initial Check**: It first checks the length of the input text (`len_text`).
   - If `len_text` is less than 200, it directly calls `self.main_model.token_count(text)` to get the token count.
   
2. **Sampling for Longer Texts**: For longer texts (over 200 characters), it employs a sampling technique:
   - The text is split into lines using `text.splitlines(keepends=True)`.
   - It calculates the number of lines (`num_lines`) and determines the step size for sampling based on this.
   - Only every nth line (where n is determined by `step`) is selected to form a sample text.
   
3. **Token Count Estimation**: The token count of the sampled text is obtained using `self.main_model.token_count(sample_text)`.
   - This sample token count (`sample_tokens`) is then used to estimate the total number of tokens in the original text by scaling it up proportionally: 
     ```python
     est_tokens = sample_tokens / len(sample_text) * len_text
     ```

4. **Return Value**: The estimated token count `est_tokens` is returned.

This function plays a crucial role within the `RepoMap` class, particularly in the context of estimating the token count for repository maps and other text-based operations where direct computation might be resource-intensive or impractical due to large input sizes.

**Note**: When dealing with very large texts, this method provides an efficient approximation rather than exact token counts. It is important to ensure that `self.main_model` and its methods are properly configured before calling this function.

**Output Example**: If the input text "This is a sample text." has 14 tokens (as per some model), and it is part of a longer document with 500 characters, the function might return an estimated token count based on sampling. For instance, if the sampled lines give a token count of 20 for those lines, the estimation could be around 70 tokens for the entire text (assuming proportional scaling).

***
### FunctionDef load_tags_cache(self)
**load_tags_cache**: The function of `load_tags_cache` is to load or create a tags cache based on the specified directory path.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The `load_tags_cache` method initializes or reloads the tags cache for an instance of the `RepoMap` class. It first constructs the path to the cache directory using the root directory and a predefined constant `TAGS_CACHE_DIR`. The cache is loaded from this directory if it exists, using the `Cache` class. If there are any SQLite errors during this process (e.g., due to issues with the cache file), the function handles these errors by attempting to recreate the cache or falling back to an in-memory dictionary.

- **Path Construction**: The path to the tags cache directory is constructed using the `root` attribute of the instance and a predefined constant `TAGS_CACHE_DIR`. This ensures that the correct location for the cache is always used.
  
- **Cache Initialization**: The function tries to initialize the `TAGS_CACHE` attribute with an instance of the `Cache` class. If the path does not exist or if there are any issues, it attempts to delete and recreate the cache directory.

- **Error Handling**: If the cache cannot be initialized due to errors (such as `SQLITE_ERRORS`), a warning is logged, and the function falls back to using an in-memory dictionary for the tags cache. This ensures that the application can still operate even if the persistent cache fails.

**Note**: The `load_tags_cache` method is called during the initialization of a `RepoMap` instance in its `__init__` method. This ensures that the tags cache is always ready when the `RepoMap` object is created, providing consistent and efficient access to tag-related data throughout the application's lifecycle.
***
### FunctionDef save_tags_cache(self)
**save_tags_cache**: The function of save_tags_cache is to update the tags cache by saving the current state of file tags.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The `save_tags_cache` method is responsible for updating and persisting the tags cache within the `RepoMap` class. It is called internally when necessary, such as after a successful update of file tags in the `get_tags` method.

1. **Cache Check**: The function first checks whether the current modification time (`file_mtime`) of the file has changed since the last cache update. If no changes are detected, it returns immediately without updating the cache.
2. **Cache Retrieval and Validation**:
   - It retrieves the cached data for the given file using `cache_key`.
   - If a valid cache entry exists with matching modification times, it directly returns the cached tags data.
3. **Cache Update**: 
   - Since there is no valid cache or the cache needs to be updated, it fetches the new tags data by calling `get_tags_raw` and stores this data in the cache under the key `cache_key`.
   - The cache entry includes both the current modification time (`file_mtime`) and the newly fetched tags data.
4. **Cache Persistence**:
   - The function then attempts to persist this updated cache entry using `self.TAGS_CACHE[cache_key] = {"mtime": file_mtime, "data": data}`.
   - If an error occurs during persistence (e.g., a SQLite error), it handles the exception by logging the error and still stores the cache entry.

The relationship with its callers in the project is as follows:
- `get_tags`: This method calls `save_tags_cache` after successfully updating file tags. This ensures that any changes made to the file’s tags are reflected in the cache, making subsequent requests more efficient by serving from the updated cache rather than recalculating or fetching data.

**Note**: Ensure that the SQLite database operations are properly handled and that errors are appropriately logged or managed to avoid data loss or corruption.
***
### FunctionDef get_mtime(self, fname)
**get_mtime**: The function of `get_mtime` is to retrieve the last modification time of a file.
· parameter1: `fname` - The path to the file whose modification time needs to be retrieved.

**Code Description**: 
The `get_mtime` method attempts to get the last modification time of a specified file using Python's built-in `os.path.getmtime` function. If the file does not exist, it catches the `FileNotFoundError` exception and logs a warning message indicating that the file was not found.
```python
def get_mtime(self, fname):
    try:
        return os.path.getmtime(fname)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        self.io.tool_warning(f"File not found error: {fname}")
```
This method is used by other methods in the `RepoMap` class to check if files have been modified since they were last processed. For example, it is called within the `get_tags` and `render_tree` methods to ensure that operations are only performed when the file has actually changed.

**Note**: Ensure that the `fname` parameter passed to this method is a valid path to an existing file; otherwise, appropriate handling of the `FileNotFoundError` will be necessary. The `io.tool_warning` method logs a warning message, which can help in diagnosing issues during development and testing phases.

**Output Example**: 
If the file at `fname` exists and has been modified:
```
1628345600  # Unix timestamp
```

If the file does not exist or cannot be accessed for some reason:
```
File not found error: /path/to/nonexistent/file.txt
```

***
### FunctionDef get_tags_raw(self, fname, rel_fname)
**get_tags_raw**: The function of `get_tags_raw` is to extract tags from source code files using tree-sitter queries.
**Parameters**:
· parameter1: `fname` - A string representing the full path to the file whose tags need to be extracted.
· parameter2: `rel_fname` - A string representing the relative path to the file, often used for caching purposes.

**Code Description**: The function `get_tags_raw` is responsible for parsing and extracting relevant information from source code files by leveraging tree-sitter queries. Here’s a detailed breakdown of its operations:

1. **Language Detection and Query Retrieval**: 
   - First, it determines the programming language associated with the file using `filename_to_lang(fname)`. If no language can be determined (`lang is None`), the function returns immediately.
   - The detected language is then used to fetch the corresponding tree-sitter query file path via `get_scm_fname(lang)`.
   - If the query file does not exist, the function returns without further processing.

2. **Parsing and Query Execution**:
   - The source code of the file (`fname`) is read using `self.io.read_text(fname)`. If no content is returned, the function exits.
   - A parser for the detected language is obtained via `get_parser(lang)`, and it is used to parse the source code into a tree structure.

3. **Query Execution**:
   - The tree-sitter queries from the retrieved file are executed against the parsed tree using `execute_queries(tree, query_file_content)`. This step extracts relevant tags or identifiers based on the defined queries.
   - If no data is returned after executing the queries, the function returns an empty list.

4. **Tag Extraction and Caching**:
   - The extracted tags are processed to form a structured output suitable for further use.
   - The function updates a cache (`self.TAGS_CACHE`) with the extracted tags and their associated modification time (`file_mtime`).

5. **Error Handling**:
   - SQLite errors during caching operations are handled using `try-except` blocks, ensuring that any issues do not disrupt the overall process.

The function serves as a critical component in the code analysis pipeline, providing detailed information about identifiers, symbols, and other relevant elements within source files. It is called by `get_tags`, which handles cache checks and updates to improve performance.

**Note**: Ensure that the file paths are correctly formatted and accessible before calling this function, as issues with file paths can lead to errors or incorrect results. Additionally, handle cases where the file content might be empty or the language detection fails gracefully.

**Output Example**: 
A possible return value could be a list of dictionaries containing tag information, such as:
```python
[
    {"name": "function_name", "type": "function", "location": (10, 20)},
    {"name": "variable_name", "type": "variable", "location": (5, 30)}
]
```
This example illustrates a list of tags with their names, types, and line/column positions.

### FunctionDef render_tree(self, abs_fname, rel_fname, lois)
**render_tree**: The function of `render_tree` is to generate a formatted string representation of a file's content based on its modification time and lines of interest (LOIs).

**parameters**:
· parameter1: `abs_fname` - The absolute path to the file whose content needs to be rendered.
· parameter2: `rel_fname` - The relative path to the file, used for context within the repository structure.
· parameter3: `lois` - A list of line numbers that are considered lines of interest (LOIs) and should be marked or highlighted.

**Code Description**: 
The function `render_tree` is a key method in the `RepoMap` class responsible for generating a formatted string representation of a file's content, taking into account its modification time (`mtime`) and specific lines of interest. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Modification Time Check**: The first step involves checking if the file has been modified by comparing the current modification time (`mtime`) with the cached value. This is done using `self.get_mtime(abs_fname)`, which retrieves the last modification time of the specified file.

2. **Cache Lookup and Update**:
   - If the key `(rel_fname, tuple(sorted(lois)), mtime)` exists in `self.tree_cache`, it means that the content for this file with these LOIs has been previously computed and can be directly returned.
   - If not, or if the cached `mtime` does not match the current modification time, the function proceeds to read the file's contents using `self.io.read_text(abs_fname)`. If the file is empty, an empty string is used instead.

3. **Context Initialization**:
   - A `TreeContext` object is created with various parameters set to specific values (e.g., no line numbers, no margin). This context will be used to format and mark lines of interest.
   - The LOIs are added to the context using `context.add_lines_of_interest(lois)`, which updates the context’s internal state.

4. **Context Processing**:
   - The context's `add_context()` method is called, which likely processes the file content based on the current settings and adds necessary formatting.
   - Finally, the formatted output is obtained by calling `context.format()`, which returns a string representation of the file with highlighted LOIs.

5. **Cache Update**:
   - The result is stored in the cache under the key `(rel_fname, tuple(sorted(lois)), mtime)` to avoid redundant computations for unchanged files or changes that do not affect the content (e.g., only whitespace modifications).

6. **Return Value**: The formatted string representation of the file’s content with highlighted LOIs is returned.

This function is called by other methods in the project, particularly within `to_string` and `to_html`, which convert the repository structure into a readable format for display or further processing. It ensures that only necessary computations are performed, optimizing performance while providing accurate and relevant information about files of interest.

**Note**: Ensure that the file paths provided (`abs_fname` and `rel_fname`) are correct to avoid errors. Also, be mindful of potential issues with large files, as reading them entirely into memory could be resource-intensive.

**Output Example**: A possible return value might look like this:
```
123  // Line number
|----  // Mark indicating line is a LOI
456  // Content of the line
789  // More content
```

## FunctionDef find_src_files(directory)
**find_src_files**: The function of find_src_files is to recursively search through a specified directory and collect all source files.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: directory (str) - The path to the root directory from which the search will start.

**Code Description**:
The `find_src_files` function takes a single argument, `directory`, which should be a string representing the path to the starting directory for the file search. If the provided `directory` is not a valid directory (i.e., it does not exist or cannot be accessed), the function returns a list containing only the `directory` path as its sole element.

If the `directory` is a valid directory, the function initializes an empty list `src_files` to store the paths of all source files found. It then uses the `os.walk()` method to traverse the directory tree rooted at `directory`. For each subdirectory encountered during the traversal, it iterates over the files in that directory and appends their full path (constructed using `os.path.join(root, file)`) to the `src_files` list.

After processing all files in the directory tree, the function returns the `src_files` list containing the paths of all source files found during the search.

**Note**: Ensure that the provided `directory` is accessible and exists. The function does not handle errors related to permission issues or non-existent directories gracefully; it will simply return a list with the given path if the directory cannot be accessed.

**Output Example**:
If the `directory` parameter points to a valid directory containing several files, such as "file1.txt", "subdir/file2.py", and "file3.c", the function might return something like:

```python
['/path/to/directory/file1.txt', '/path/to/directory/subdir/file2.py', '/path/to/directory/file3.c']
```

If the directory does not exist, it would return a list containing only the provided path:

```python
['nonexistent_directory']
```
## FunctionDef get_random_color
**get_random_color**: The function of get_random_color is to generate a random color in hexadecimal format.
**parameters**: This Function has no parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `get_random_color` function generates a random color by converting a random hue value into RGB and then returning it as a hexadecimal string. Here's a detailed analysis:
1. **Random Hue Value Generation**: The variable `hue` is assigned a random floating-point number between 0 and 1 using `random.random()`. This value represents the hue component of an HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color model.
2. **RGB Conversion**: Using the `colorsys.hsv_to_rgb` function from Python's standard library, the hue (`hue`), saturation (`1` - maximum saturation), and value (`0.75`) are converted into RGB values. The resulting tuple of three floats is then mapped to integers between 0 and 255.
3. **Hexadecimal String Construction**: The integer values for red (`r`), green (`g`), and blue (`b`) are formatted as hexadecimal strings using `f"#{r:02x}{g:02x}{b:02x}"`. This format ensures that each color component is represented by two characters, padding with zeros if necessary.
4. **Return Value**: The function returns the constructed string representing a random color in hexadecimal format.

**Note**: Ensure that `colorsys` module from Python's standard library is available and properly imported before using this function. If not already included, add `import colorsys` at the beginning of your script or module.
**Output Example**: Possible return values include strings like `#4a2b3c`, `#f5e9d7`, or any other valid 6-digit hexadecimal color code.
## FunctionDef get_scm_fname(lang)
**get_scm_fname**: The function of `get_scm_fname` is to retrieve the path to the SCM (Source Code Management) file that contains tree-sitter queries for a given language.
**Parameters**:
· parameter1: `lang` - A string representing the programming language for which the tree-sitter query file needs to be located.

**Code Description**: 
The function `get_scm_fname` is designed to find and return the path of an SCM file that contains tree-sitter queries specific to a given programming language. This file is crucial for parsing and analyzing source code using tree-sitter, which is a fast parsing library. 

Firstly, it attempts to locate the query file by constructing the full path using `resources.files(__package__).joinpath("queries", f"tree-sitter-{lang}-tags.scm")`. Here, the package's resource files are searched for a directory named "queries" and then looks for a file with the name pattern "tree-sitter-{lang}-tags.scm". If the file is found, its path is returned.

If the file does not exist (raising a `KeyError`), the function returns `None`. This mechanism ensures that if no query file exists for a particular language, the function gracefully handles it without causing an error in the calling code.

This function plays a vital role in the overall process of parsing and analyzing source code. It is called by other functions like `get_tags_raw`, which uses these queries to extract relevant information from the parsed tree-sitter nodes. Specifically, `get_scm_fname` provides the necessary path that `get_tags_raw` uses to read the query file content, parse it, and apply it to the source code.

**Note**: Ensure that the resource files are correctly set up with the appropriate query files for each language before using this function. The absence of a required query file can lead to unexpected behavior or errors in downstream processes.

**Output Example**: 
If `lang` is "python", the function might return:
```
<resources_path>/queries/tree-sitter-python-tags.scm
```
## FunctionDef get_supported_languages_md
**get_supported_languages_md**: The function of `get_supported_languages_md` is to generate a Markdown-formatted table listing supported programming languages along with their file extensions, repository mappings, and linter support.

**Parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The function `get_supported_languages_md` generates a detailed Markdown table that provides information about the supported programming languages used in code repositories. Here is how it works:

1. **Imports and Initialization**: The function starts by importing `PARSERS` from `grep_ast.parsers`. This dictionary contains mappings of file extensions to their corresponding programming languages.

2. **Table Construction**: A string `res` is initialized with the Markdown table header, which includes columns for language names, file extensions, repository mappings, and linter support.

3. **Data Processing**: The function iterates over a sorted list of tuples containing file extensions and their corresponding programming languages derived from `PARSERS`.

4. **Repository Mapping Check**: For each language, the function calls `get_scm_fname(lang)` to retrieve the path to the SCM (Source Code Management) file that contains tree-sitter queries for that language. If such a file exists at the specified path, it sets `repo_map` to "✓"; otherwise, it leaves it empty.

5. **Linter Support**: The function always sets `linter_support` to "✓" as an example of consistent linter support across all languages in this context.

6. **Table Entry Construction**: For each language and its associated data, the function appends a row to the string `res`, formatting it according to the Markdown table structure.

7. **Finalization**: After processing all entries, the function adds an extra newline character to the result string for better readability.

8. **Return Value**: The final constructed Markdown table is returned as the output of the function.

The function relies on `get_scm_fname` from the same module to determine if a repository mapping file exists for each language. This ensures that the generated table accurately reflects which languages have associated query files and, by extension, are supported in terms of parsing and linting.

**Note**: Ensure that the resource files are correctly set up with the appropriate query files for each language before using this function. The absence of a required query file can lead to incomplete or misleading information in the generated Markdown table.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value might look like:

```
| Language           | File extension     | Repo map | Linter |
|:------------------:|:-----------------:|:--------:|:------:|

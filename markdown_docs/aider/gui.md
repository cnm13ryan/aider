### FunctionDef tool_output(self, msg, log_only)
**tool_output**: The function of tool_output is to output messages either by appending them to a list or logging them.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: msg - The message to be outputted.
· parameter2: log_only (optional) - A boolean value indicating whether the message should only be logged and not appended to the lines list. Default is False.

**Code Description**: The tool_output function serves as a method for handling message outputs in the CaptureIO class, allowing messages to be either stored in the object's internal state or logged externally based on the log_only parameter.
- If `log_only` is set to `False`, the message (`msg`) is appended to the `lines` list. This means that the message will be retained within the object for potential later retrieval or processing, allowing for a history of messages outputted by this instance.
- Regardless of whether `log_only` is True or False, the function also calls the `tool_output` method from its superclass using the same parameters (`msg`, `log_only`). This ensures that any additional logging or handling defined in the parent class is executed, providing a consistent interface for message output across different classes and their derivatives.

**Note**: When deciding whether to set `log_only` to True, consider scenarios where you want to log messages without storing them internally. For instance, this might be useful when dealing with sensitive information that should not be retained in memory or stored locally. Always ensure that the `lines` list is properly managed if it's used for retaining message history, as it can grow indefinitely if not cleared periodically.
***
### FunctionDef tool_error(self, msg)
**tool_error**: The function of tool_error is to append an error message to the lines list and propagate it up the call stack using the superclass method.
**parameters**:
· msg: A string representing the error message to be appended.

**Code Description**: 
The `tool_error` function serves as a handler for error messages. It takes a single parameter, `msg`, which is expected to be a string containing the error message that needs to be recorded or logged. The function performs two main actions:
1. Appends the provided `msg` to the `lines` list attribute of the current object. This could be used to keep track of all errors encountered during program execution.
2. Calls the superclass's `tool_error` method with the same message, ensuring that any error handling logic defined in the parent class is also executed.

This function is typically used within a subclass where custom error handling or logging needs are required while still leveraging the error-handling mechanisms provided by the superclass.

**Note**: Ensure that the `lines` attribute exists and is properly initialized before using this method. Also, be aware that the behavior of the method depends on the implementation of the superclass's `tool_error` method; therefore, any assumptions about its functionality should be based on the documented or known behavior of that method.
***
### FunctionDef tool_warning(self, msg)
**tool_warning**: The function of tool_warning is to append a warning message to the lines list and then call the superclass's tool_warning method.

**parameters**: 
· parameter1: msg (str)
    - This parameter represents the warning message that will be appended to the `lines` list and passed to the superclass's `tool_warning` method.

**Code Description**: 
This function serves as a method within the `CaptureIO` class, specifically for handling warnings. It performs two primary actions:
1. **Appending Message to Lines List**: The first action is appending the provided message (`msg`) to an internal list named `lines`. This list likely accumulates various messages over time, possibly for logging or review purposes.
2. **Calling Superclass Method**: After appending the message, the function calls its superclass's `tool_warning` method with the same message (`msg`). This ensures that any additional handling specific to the superclass is also performed.

The use of `super().tool_warning(msg)` indicates that this class extends another class (presumably part of a more complex system), and it delegates warning handling responsibilities to the parent class. This pattern helps maintain a clean separation of concerns, where each class in the inheritance hierarchy can handle warnings according to its specific needs.

**Note**: Ensure that the `lines` list is properly initialized before calling this method. Also, verify that the superclass has an appropriate implementation of the `tool_warning` method to avoid runtime errors.
***
### FunctionDef get_captured_lines(self)
**get_captured_lines**: The function of get_captured_lines is to retrieve all lines captured so far and reset the line storage.
**parameters**: This Function has no parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `get_captured_lines` method serves to extract all the lines that have been captured by the instance of the class since its last initialization or reset. After retrieving these lines, it clears the internal list (`self.lines`) used for storing the lines, effectively resetting the storage. This mechanism is useful in scenarios where you need to process a batch of captured data and then prepare for new captures.

Here's a detailed analysis:
- **lines**: The method accesses the `lines` attribute, which presumably holds a collection (likely a list) of strings representing each line that has been captured.
- **self.lines = []**: After extracting the lines into the `lines` variable, it resets the `lines` attribute to an empty list. This ensures that any subsequent calls to `get_captured_lines` will start with an empty storage.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `lines` attribute is properly initialized in the constructor or at the beginning of your class.
- If you need to capture lines continuously, consider using a different method for capturing new lines and use `get_captured_lines` only when you want to retrieve and reset the captured data.

**Output Example**: 
If the `lines` list contained "Line 1", "Line 2", and "Line 3" before calling `get_captured_lines`, the function would return a list containing these three lines, and `self.lines` would be set back to an empty list. For example:
```python
# Example before call
self.lines = ["Line 1", "Line 2", "Line 3"]

# After calling get_captured_lines
lines = self.get_captured_lines()
print(lines)  # Output: ['Line 1', 'Line 2', 'Line 3']
print(self.lines)  # Output: []
```
***
## FunctionDef search(text)
**search**: The function of search is to recursively scan directories and return a list of file paths containing a specified text substring.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: text (optional)
    - A string that filters files based on whether their path contains this string.

**Code Description**:
The `search` function is designed to perform a recursive directory search, returning all file paths within the "aider" directory tree that contain a specified text substring. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty list named `results`, which will store the paths of files matching the criteria.

2. **Directory Walk**: It uses the built-in `os.walk` function to traverse through all directories starting from "aider". For each directory, it yields a 3-tuple containing the root path (current directory), a list of subdirectories within that root, and a list of filenames in that root.

3. **File Path Construction**: For each file found in the current directory, it constructs its full path using `os.path.join(root, file)`.

4. **Path Filtering**: The function checks if the constructed path contains the specified text (if provided). If the text is not provided or the path includes the text, the path is appended to the `results` list.

5. **Return Results**: Finally, it returns the `results` list containing all file paths that match the search criteria.

6. **Commented Code**: The commented line `# dump(results)` suggests an intention to print the results for debugging purposes but has been removed from the final code, indicating a possible placeholder or comment left during development.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the "aider" directory is correctly specified and accessible.
- The function does not handle cases where no files match the search criteria; it simply returns an empty list in such scenarios.
- The `os.walk` function processes directories recursively, which may take time for large directory structures. Consider performance implications when using this function on large datasets.

**Output Example**: 
```python
['aider/documents/report1.txt', 'aider/downloads/image.jpg']
```
This example shows that the search returned paths to two files: `report1.txt` and `image.jpg`, both of which contain the specified text substring in their file paths.
## ClassDef State
**State**: The function of State is to manage state attributes by ensuring each attribute key is unique.
**Attributes**: 
· keys: A set that stores all the keys of the attributes currently defined on the instance.

**Code Description**: The `State` class is designed to handle and manage a collection of attributes with unique keys. It ensures that no two attributes share the same key, which can be useful in scenarios where attribute names need to be distinct. Here's how it works:

1. **Initialization (`__init__` method)**: When an instance of `State` is created, the `__init__` method checks if a given key already exists in the `keys` set. If the key does not exist, it adds the key to the set and sets the attribute with the provided value (if any). The method returns `True` after successfully adding a new attribute.

2. **Key Management**: The class uses a `set` called `keys` to keep track of all unique keys that have been assigned as attributes. This ensures that each key is used only once per instance, preventing duplicate attribute names.

3. **Adding Attributes**: When you call the `__init__` method with a key and an optional value, it checks if the key already exists in the `keys` set. If not, it adds the key to the set and sets the corresponding attribute on the object. This mechanism helps in maintaining a clean and organized state management system.

**Note**: The class does not provide any getter or setter methods for attributes directly. You can access the attributes using standard Python attribute syntax (e.g., `instance.key`), but adding new keys requires calling the `__init__` method with those keys.

**Output Example**: If you create an instance of `State` and add multiple keys, here's an example:
```python
state = State()
state.init('name', 'Alice')
state.init('age', 30)
print(state.name)  # Output: Alice
print(state.age)   # Output: 30
```
In this example, the `State` instance is created and two attributes (`name` and `age`) are added. The `keys` set will contain `{'name', 'age'}`, ensuring that no other attribute can be added with these keys.
### FunctionDef init(self, key, val)
**init**: The function of `init` is to initialize or add new state variables.
**parameters**: 
· key: str - The name of the state variable to be initialized.
· val: Any (optional) - The initial value of the state variable.

**Code Description**: 
The `init` method in the `State` class is responsible for adding a new state variable if it does not already exist. It first checks whether the given key is present in the `self.keys` set, which contains all keys that have been initialized so far. If the key is not found, the method adds the key to `self.keys` and sets its value using `setattr`. Finally, it returns `True` to indicate successful initialization.

The `init` method ensures that each state variable is only added once by checking for its presence in the `keys` set before performing any operations. This helps maintain a clean and organized state management system within the application.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that all keys passed to `init` are valid strings.
- The `val` parameter can be of any type, depending on the context in which it is used.
- The method returns `True`, but this return value is not strictly necessary for its core functionality; it could be omitted if desired.

**Output Example**: 
```python
# Example 1: Adding a new state variable with an initial value
state = State()
state.init("messages", messages)
print(state.messages)  # Output: [dict(role="info", content="Welcome!"), dict(role="assistant", content="How can I help you?")]

# Example 2: Attempting to add the same key again (should not change anything)
state.init("messages", new_messages)
print(state.messages)  # Output remains unchanged
```
***
## FunctionDef get_state
**get_state**: The function of `get_state` is to return an instance of the `State` class.
**parameters**: This function has no parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `get_state` function simply calls and returns an instance of the `State` class. As described in the documentation for the `State` class, this function ensures that all attributes added to the returned instance have unique keys stored in a set called `keys`. When you call `init` on the returned `State` object with a key and optional value, it checks if the key already exists in `keys`. If not, it adds the key to `keys`, sets the corresponding attribute, and returns `True`.

In the context of the project, this function is called by the `__init__` method of the `GUI` class. This indicates that the state management functionality provided by the `State` class is crucial for initializing the GUI's internal state, which includes handling user inputs, managing chat messages, and updating input history.

The `get_state` function plays a vital role in ensuring that all attributes used within the GUI are unique and properly managed. By returning an instance of `State`, it allows other parts of the code to easily manage and access these attributes while maintaining their uniqueness.
**Note**: Ensure that any attribute added via `init` on the returned `State` object adheres to the uniqueness constraint enforced by the `keys` set in the `State` class. This helps prevent conflicts and ensures a clean state management system throughout the application.
**Output Example**: 
```python
state_instance = get_state()
state_instance.init('name', 'Alice')
state_instance.init('age', 30)
print(state_instance.name)  # Output: Alice
print(state_instance.age)   # Output: 30
```
This example demonstrates how `get_state` returns a `State` instance, and attributes can be added using the `init` method.

## Function Signature

```python
def calculateDiscount(original_price: float, discount_rate: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the discount amount for a given original price and discount rate.
    
    Parameters:
    - original_price (float): The original price of the item before applying any discounts.
    - discount_rate (float): The discount rate as a percentage. For example, 10% would be represented as 0.10.

    Returns:
    - float: The calculated discount amount.
    
    Raises:
    - ValueError: If `original_price` or `discount_rate` is negative.
    """
```

## Parameters

- **original_price**: A floating-point number representing the original price of the item before any discounts are applied. This value must be a non-negative number.

- **discount_rate**: A floating-point number representing the discount rate as a percentage. For instance, 10% would be input as `0.10`. The discount rate must also be a non-negative number.

## Return Value

- **float**: The calculated discount amount, which is the product of the original price and the discount rate.

## Example Usage

```python
# Example 1: Calculate the discount for an item with an original price of $100 and a discount rate of 20%
discount_amount = calculateDiscount(100.0, 0.20)
print(discount_amount)  # Output: 20.0

# Example 2: Calculate the discount for an item with an original price of $50 and a discount rate of 5%
discount_amount = calculateDiscount(50.0, 0.05)

   - A text input field labeled "git" is provided, pre-filled with the string "git ".
   - A button labeled "Run" is added using the `button` method, which allows users to execute a custom Git command entered in the text input field. Similar to the previous button, this one also checks if there is an active prompt before enabling.
   - A selectbox named "Recent git commands" is included with two options: "git checkout -b experiment" and "git stash". This selectbox is disabled if there is a pending prompt, preventing users from selecting commands during critical operations.

The `do_git` method integrates these interactive elements to provide a user-friendly interface for performing Git operations within the Streamlit application. By leveraging the `button`, `expander`, `popover`, and `selectbox` methods provided by Streamlit, it ensures that the UI remains responsive and predictable while maintaining a consistent experience for users.

**Note**: Ensure that the `button` method is called appropriately to disable buttons when there is an active prompt, as this helps maintain the integrity of interactions with the Large Language Model (LLM) during critical operations. Additionally, using these interactive elements effectively guides users through Git commands and ensures they do not inadvertently commit changes or execute commands while a prompt is pending.

### FunctionDef do_recent_msgs(self)
**do_recent_msgs**: The function of do_recent_msgs is to manage and display recent chat messages in the user interface.
**parameters**: This method does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The `do_recent_msgs` method plays a crucial role in updating and displaying recent chat messages in the user interface. It performs several key actions:
1. **Check for Recent Messages**: The first condition checks if there are any recent messages by evaluating the state of `self.recent_msgs_empty`. If no recent messages exist, it sets `self.recent_msgs_empty` to an empty space using `st.empty()`.
2. **Handle Prompt Pending State**: The method then calls `self.prompt_pending()` to check whether a prompt is pending. If a prompt is active (`prompt_pending` returns `True`), the method clears any existing recent messages by calling `self.recent_msgs_empty.empty()` and increments the number of recent messages using `self.state.recent_msgs_num += 1`.
3. **Display Recent Messages**: The method then creates a dropdown menu using `st.selectbox`. This select box allows users to choose from their previous input history (`self.state.input_history`). It includes a placeholder text for when no options are selected and sets the key dynamically based on the recent messages count.
4. **Update Prompt State**: If a user selects an option in the dropdown, the method updates `self.prompt` with the selected message.

This function is called within the broader context of managing the sidebar navigation in the GUI (`do_sidebar`). Specifically, it ensures that recent chat messages are dynamically updated and displayed based on user interactions or state changes. The interaction between `do_recent_msgs` and other methods like `prompt_pending` helps maintain a responsive and interactive user interface.

**Note**: Ensure that this method is called at appropriate intervals to keep the UI up-to-date with the latest information. It should be integrated seamlessly into the overall flow of the GUI to provide a cohesive experience for users interacting with recent chat messages.
***
### FunctionDef do_messages_container(self)
**do_messages_container**: The function of `do_messages_container` is to manage and display chat messages within a container on the GUI.

**Parameters**:
· None: This function does not take any parameters directly but relies on attributes set during its initialization and state management.

**Code Description**:
The `do_messages_container` method is responsible for rendering chat messages in a structured manner. It initializes a container to hold all the messages, then iterates through the list of messages stored in the state. Depending on the message type (role), it handles the display differently:

1. **Initialization**: The function starts by initializing a container using `st.container()`. This container will be used to group and layout the chat messages.
   
2. **Vertical Whitespace**: Initially, there is commented-out code that would add vertical whitespace at the top of the container. This was intended to push all chat text to the bottom but has been disabled.

3. **Message Iteration**: The function then iterates through each message in `self.state.messages`. For each message:
   - If the role is "edit", it calls `show_edit_info` with the message details.
   - If the role is "info", it displays an informational message using `st.info`.
   - If the role is "text", it splits the content into lines and uses `st.chat_message("user")` to display the text within an expander, allowing users to expand and read the full message.
   - If the role is either "user" or "assistant", it uses `st.chat_message()` to display the user or assistant input, respectively. This method also appends the prompt to the history if needed.

4. **State Management**: The function interacts with the state object to ensure that messages are properly appended and displayed. It checks for pending prompts and processes them accordingly.

The function is called after initializing other components of the GUI (`do_messages_container()` in `__init__`) and is crucial for maintaining a consistent and organized display of chat interactions throughout the application.

**Note**: Ensure that all necessary state attributes are correctly initialized before calling this method. Additionally, be mindful of performance implications when dealing with large numbers of messages, as each message rendering could impact the overall user experience.
***
### FunctionDef initialize_state(self)
**initialize_state**: The function of initialize_state is to set up initial state variables required for the GUI operation.

**parameters**: 
· self: The instance of the class calling this method.

**Code Description**: 

The `initialize_state` method initializes several key state variables that are essential for the proper functioning of the GUI. Here’s a detailed breakdown of what each initialization step does:

1. **Messages Initialization**:
   - A list of messages is created, starting with an info message based on the content returned by `self.announce()`, and followed by a default assistant message asking how they can help.
   - This setup ensures that the GUI starts with relevant initial information and prompts for interaction.

2. **State Variable Initialization**:
   - The method initializes various state variables such as `last_aider_commit_hash`, `recent_msgs_num`, `web_content_num`, `prompt`, `scraper`, and `initial_inchat_files`.
   - These variables are crucial for tracking the current state of the application, including recent commit hashes, message counts, user prompts, and file references.
   
3. **Input History Initialization**:
   - If the `input_history` key does not already exist in the state keys, it is initialized with a filtered list of unique input history items from the coder's system.
   - The filtering ensures that duplicate entries are removed, maintaining a clean and concise history.

4. **State Management**:
   - For each variable being initialized, `self.state` (the current application state) is updated to reflect these new values.
   - This step ensures that all necessary data structures are set up before the GUI begins its operation, providing a consistent starting point for further interactions.

The `initialize_state` method is called during the initialization phase of the GUI. It sets up the foundational state required for subsequent operations such as handling user inputs, managing chat messages, and updating the UI based on these states. The method references several other parts of the application:
- **Caller**: The `__init__` method in `GUI/__init__` calls `initialize_state` to ensure that all necessary state variables are set up before the GUI starts its operation.
- **Callees**: This method indirectly interacts with `announce`, which provides initial messages, and it updates the state through the `state` object.

**Note**: Ensure that the `announce` method is correctly implemented to provide meaningful initial messages. Also, verify that all referenced state variables (`last_aider_commit_hash`, etc.) are properly defined elsewhere in your application to avoid runtime errors.
***
### FunctionDef button(self, args)
**button**: The function of `button` is to create a button widget that can be disabled if there is an active prompt pending.
**parameters**: 
· args: The label or text displayed on the button.
· **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments passed to the underlying Streamlit `st.button` function.

**Code Description**: The `button` method in the GUI class checks whether a prompt is currently pending using the `prompt_pending` method. If a prompt is active, it sets the "disabled" parameter of the button creation to True, effectively disabling the button until the prompt is resolved. This ensures that users cannot interact with critical UI elements during important operations like processing prompts.

The method then returns an instance of Streamlit's `st.button` component with the provided arguments and any additional keyword arguments passed in. By integrating this functionality into various parts of the GUI, it helps maintain a consistent user experience by preventing accidental interactions and ensuring that the system remains responsive and predictable during critical stages of conversation or data input.

This method is called in several places within the project:
- In `add_undo`, it ensures that the "Undo commit" button is disabled if there's an active prompt.
- In `do_recommended_actions` and `do_git`, it disables relevant buttons to prevent user interaction during critical operations like committing changes or running git commands.

The use of `button` in these contexts helps to maintain a consistent user experience by preventing accidental interactions with the UI while important processes are ongoing. It also ensures that certain actions cannot be initiated until the current prompt is resolved, thus maintaining the integrity of the interaction with the Large Language Model (LLM).

**Note**: Ensure that this method is called at appropriate intervals, especially when handling user inputs or LLM responses to avoid unnecessary disruptions.

**Output Example**: The function returns a button widget in Streamlit. For example:
```python
if self.prompt_pending():
    st.write("Please wait while the system processes your request.")
else:
    # Proceed with normal operations
    if self.button("Proceed", key="proceed"):
        # Perform some action
```
This output determines whether certain UI elements or actions should be enabled or disabled based on the presence of a pending prompt.

***
### FunctionDef prompt_pending(self)
**prompt_pending**: The function of `prompt_pending` is to check if there is an active prompt that needs attention.
**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `prompt_pending` method checks whether a prompt exists and requires the user's attention by returning `True` if a prompt is pending, otherwise it returns `False`. It is used to determine when certain UI elements or actions should be disabled. This functionality ensures that critical operations are not performed while a prompt is active, maintaining the integrity of the interaction with the Large Language Model (LLM).

This method is called in various parts of the GUI to control the state and behavior of different components. For instance:
- In `do_add_files`, it disables the file selection input when there is an active prompt.
- Similarly, in `do_add_image`, `do_run_shell`, and other methods, it ensures that certain actions are not initiated while a prompt is pending.

The use of `prompt_pending` helps to maintain a consistent user experience by preventing accidental interactions with the UI during critical stages of conversation or data input. It also aids in ensuring that the system remains responsive and predictable for the user.
**Note**: Ensure that this method is called at appropriate intervals, especially when handling user inputs or LLM responses to avoid unnecessary disruptions.
**Output Example**: The function returns `True` if there is an active prompt, otherwise it returns `False`. For example:
```python
if self.prompt_pending():
    st.write("Please wait while the system processes your request.")
else:
    # Proceed with normal operations
```
This output determines whether certain UI elements or actions should be enabled or disabled based on the presence of a pending prompt.
***
### FunctionDef cost(self)
**cost**: The function of cost is to calculate and display a random cost value.
**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `cost` method generates and displays a random cost value within a specific range. Here's the detailed breakdown:

1. **Random Cost Calculation**: 
   ```python
   cost = random.random() * 0.003 + 0.001
   ```
   - `random.random()` returns a random floating-point number between 0 and 1.
   - Multiplying this by `0.003` scales the range to be between `0` and `0.003`.
   - Adding `0.001` shifts the entire range to start from `0.001` to `0.004`, ensuring a minimum cost of at least $0.001.

2. **Displaying the Cost**:
   ```python
   st.caption(f"${cost:0.4f}")
   ```
   - The `st` object is assumed to be a reference to a Streamlit instance or similar framework that allows text display.
   - The `caption()` method is used to create a caption or header-like element within the application interface.
   - The f-string `f"${cost:0.4f}"` formats the cost value as a dollar amount, rounded to four decimal places (`0.4f`).

**Note**: Ensure that the `st` object is properly initialized and available in the context where this function is called. Additionally, make sure that the `random` module has been imported at the beginning of your script for the random number generation functionality to work correctly.

***
### FunctionDef info(self, message, echo)
**info**: The function of `info` is to log an informational message and optionally display it on the GUI.
**parameters**:
· message: The content of the informational message to be logged and potentially displayed.
· echo (default=True): A boolean flag indicating whether the message should also be displayed on the GUI.

**Code Description**: 
The `info` function is a method within the `GUI` class, responsible for logging an informational message. It takes two parameters: `message`, which contains the content of the message to be logged and potentially displayed, and `echo`, a boolean flag that determines whether the message should also be rendered on the GUI.

1. **Logging Message**: The function creates a dictionary `info` with keys `"role"` set to `"info"` and `"content"` set to the provided `message`. This dictionary is then appended to the `state.messages` list, which presumably contains all messages logged by the application.
2. **Displaying on GUI (if echo=True)**: If `echo` is set to `True`, the function calls another method `messages.info(message)` from the same class instance (`self`). This likely updates a UI component or section dedicated to displaying informational messages.

**Note**: The use of `echo=True` suggests that this function can be used both for logging purposes and for providing real-time feedback on the GUI. When `echo` is set to `False`, only the message is logged without being displayed, which could be useful in scenarios where excessive UI updates are undesirable or unnecessary.

This method is called by several other functions within the project:
- In `do_add_files`, it logs and displays messages when files are added or removed from the chat.
- In `do_clear_chat_history`, it clears the chat history and informs the user of the action taken.
- In `process_chat`, it provides feedback on reflections made during the chat process.
- In `do_web`, it handles informational messages related to web content scraping.
- In `do_undo`, it logs information about undone commits without necessarily displaying it, ensuring that important actions are recorded even if they do not require immediate UI updates.

These calls demonstrate that `info` plays a crucial role in maintaining communication between the backend logging and frontend user interface, providing both developers and users with necessary feedback during application execution.

***
### FunctionDef do_undo(self, commit_hash)
**do_undo**: The function of `do_undo` is to handle the undo action for a specific commit hash.
**parameters**:
· commit_hash: The unique identifier of the commit to be undone.

**Code Description**: 
The `do_undo` method within the `GUI` class serves as a crucial component in managing the undo functionality for commits. Here’s how it works:

1. **Clearing Previous State**: It first clears any previous empty state by calling `self.last_undo_empty.empty()`. This ensures that if there was an ongoing undo operation, it is reset before proceeding.

2. **Commit Hash Validation**: The method then checks whether the current commit hash (`commit_hash`) matches the last committed change made by both the coder and the state. If they do not match, it logs a message indicating that the specified commit is not the latest one using `self.info(f"Commit `{commit_hash}` is not the latest commit.")` and returns early without performing any further actions.

3. **Fetching Lines**: Assuming the commit hash matches, it retrieves the lines of code from the coder’s state by calling `self.coder.commands.io.get_captured_lines()`.

4. **Executing Undo Command**: It then executes an undo command on the coder's commands using `reply = self.coder.commands.cmd_undo(None)`. This could involve reverting changes made in the previous commit.

5. **Processing Output Lines**: The output lines from the undo command are processed to format them for display: 
   - Joining the lines with a newline character (`\n`).
   - Splitting the joined string into individual lines.
   - Joining these lines with an extra space and newline (`"  \n"`), presumably to enhance readability.

6. **Logging and Display**: The formatted output is logged using `self.info(lines, echo=False)`, which ensures it is recorded but not necessarily displayed on the GUI immediately (due to `echo=False`).

7. **Updating State**: Finally, the method updates its internal state by setting `self.state.last_undone_commit_hash = commit_hash`. This helps in keeping track of the last undone commit for future reference.

8. **Handling Reply**: If a reply is received from the undo command (`reply`), it resets the prompt and sets the new prompt to this reply using `self.prompt_as = None` and `self.prompt = reply`.

**Note**: The method assumes that the coder's state and commands are properly set up before calling `do_undo`. It also relies on the `info` method for logging messages, which is crucial for maintaining a record of actions taken during the application’s execution.

This method is called by the `add_undo` function when a user interacts with an undo button. This integration ensures that users can easily revert to previous states while keeping track of these changes through logs and potential GUI updates.

**Output Example**: The output would be formatted lines of text representing the undone commit, logged internally but not necessarily displayed on the GUI. For example:
```
  \nReverted changes for commit `abc123`.
```

## FunctionDef gui_main
# Object Documentation: `UserAuthenticationService`

## Overview

The `UserAuthenticationService` is a critical component of our application designed to manage user authentication processes securely. This service handles user login, registration, and logout functionalities, ensuring that only authenticated users can access protected resources.

## Key Features

- **User Registration**: Allows new users to create accounts.
- **User Login**: Enables registered users to log in using their credentials.
- **Logout Functionality**: Provides a mechanism for users to log out of the system.
- **Token Management**: Manages authentication tokens, ensuring that they are valid and secure.

## Usage

### Registering a New User
To register a new user, call the `registerUser` method with the required parameters. The service will validate the input data and create a new user if the registration is successful.

**Example:**
```javascript
const userService = new UserAuthenticationService();
await userService.registerUser({
  username: "john_doe",
  email: "john.doe@example.com",
  password: "securePassword123"
});
```

### Logging In a User
To log in a user, use the `loginUser` method with their credentials. If the login is successful, the service will return an authentication token that can be used for subsequent API requests.

**Example:**
```javascript
const userService = new UserAuthenticationService();
const token = await userService.loginUser({
  username: "john_doe",
  password: "securePassword123"
});
```

### Logging Out a User
To log out a user, use the `logoutUser` method with their authentication token. This will invalidate the token and remove it from the session.

**Example:**
```javascript
const userService = new UserAuthenticationService();
await userService.logoutUser("validToken");
```

## Security Considerations

- **Password Hashing**: Passwords are stored as hashed values to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Secure Tokens**: Authentication tokens are generated using secure algorithms and are valid for a limited time period.
- **Session Management**: Sessions are managed securely to ensure that only authorized users have access.

## Error Handling

The `UserAuthenticationService` method implementations throw specific error objects when encountering issues. These errors include:

- **InvalidCredentialsError**: Thrown when login credentials are incorrect.
- **DuplicateUsernameError**: Thrown when a username is already registered.
- **TokenExpiredError**: Thrown when an authentication token has expired.

**Example:**
```javascript
try {
  await userService.loginUser({
    username: "invalid_user",
    password: "wrong_password"
  });
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof InvalidCredentialsError) {
    console.error("Invalid credentials provided.");
  }
}
```

## Dependencies

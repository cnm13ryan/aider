### FunctionDef looks_like_html(self, content)
**looks_like_html**: The function of `looks_like_html` is to determine whether the given content appears to be HTML.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: `content` (str) - The input content to check if it resembles HTML.

**Code Description**:
The `looks_like_html` method checks if a provided string of text contains common patterns that are indicative of HTML. It performs this check by using regular expressions to search for specific HTML tags and patterns within the content. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Type Check**: The function first ensures that the input `content` is a string.
2. **Pattern Matching**: If the content is indeed a string, it then checks for the presence of several common HTML patterns using regular expressions:
   - `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This tag indicates the document type and is often used in HTML documents to declare the document's type and version.
   - `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`: These tags are fundamental to an HTML structure, representing the root element of the document, head section, and body section respectively.
   - `<div>`, `<p>`, `<a href>`: These tags represent various elements that are commonly used in HTML for structuring and linking content.

3. **Return Value**: If any of these patterns are found within the `content`, the function returns `True`, indicating that the content likely resembles an HTML document. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This method is called by the `scrape` function to determine if a retrieved piece of content should be processed as HTML before converting it into markdown using Pandoc.

**Note**: The function assumes that the input content is a string and does not handle other types of inputs directly. Ensure that only text data is passed to this function for accurate results.

**Output Example**: If the `content` variable contains `<html><body>Hello, World!</body></html>`, then `looks_like_html(content)` would return `True`. If the `content` variable instead contained plain text like "Hello, World!", it would return `False`.
***
### FunctionDef scrape_with_playwright(self, url)
**scrape_with_playwright**: The function of `scrape_with_playwright` is to scrape a URL using Playwright, a popular Node library for automating browsers.

**parameters**:
· url: The URL to be scraped.

**Code Description**:
The `scrape_with_playwright` method uses the Playwright library to interact with web pages in a headless browser. It performs several steps to retrieve and process the content from the given URL:

1. **Importing Modules**: 
   - Import necessary modules from Playwright, including error handling classes.
   - Initialize the `sync_playwright` context manager to launch a Chromium browser.

2. **Launching Browser**:
   - Attempt to launch a Chromium browser using `p.chromium.launch()`.
   - If launching fails due to an exception, set `playwright_available` to False and print the error message before returning None for both content and mime type.

3. **Creating Context and Page**:
   - Create a new context with `ignore_https_errors=not self.verify_ssl`, allowing ignoring SSL errors if necessary.
   - Open a new page within this context.

4. **Setting User-Agent Header**:
   - Modify the user-agent string by removing "Headless" and appending an additional user agent identifier from `aider_user_agent`.

5. **Navigating to URL**:
   - Use `page.goto(url)` to navigate to the specified URL.
   - If navigation fails, handle errors appropriately.

6. **Retrieving Content**:
   - Once the page is loaded, retrieve the content using `page.content()`.
   - Determine the mime type of the content based on its structure or other metadata.

7. **Error Handling and Cleanup**:
   - Handle potential errors during the process.
   - Close the browser context when done to free up resources.

8. **Returning Results**:
   - Return the retrieved content and its mime type as a tuple.

This function is called by higher-level methods in the `Scraper` class, which decide whether to use Playwright or other scraping techniques based on availability and requirements. By providing detailed control over browser interactions, it ensures that complex web pages can be scraped accurately.

**Note**: Ensure that the required dependencies are installed and available before running this function. Also, consider handling timeouts and retries for more robust behavior in real-world scenarios.

**Output Example**: The method might return a tuple like `("This is plain text content.", "text/plain")` if scraping a simple text page. For an HTML page, it could return something like `("<html><body><h1>Test</h1></body></html>", "text/html")`.
***
### FunctionDef scrape_with_httpx(self, url)
**scrape_with_httpx**: The function of `scrape_with_httpx` is to scrape a given URL using the httpx library.

**parameters**:
· url: The URL to be scraped.

**Code Description**: 
The `scrape_with_httpx` method in the Scraper class is responsible for fetching content from a specified URL using the httpx HTTP client. It sets up headers with a user agent string and then makes an HTTP GET request to the provided URL. If the request is successful, it returns the HTML content as text along with the MIME type (extracted from the response headers). In case of any HTTP errors or other exceptions, appropriate error messages are logged using the `print_error` method.

The function ensures robust handling by catching and logging both httpx.HTTPError and generic Exception. If an error occurs, it returns None for both content and MIME type to indicate failure in retrieval.

This method is called internally when a Scraper instance needs to fetch content from a URL, either as part of the main scraping process or as a fallback mechanism if other methods fail. It provides a reliable way to retrieve web content while handling potential issues gracefully.

**Note**: Ensure that the `aider_user_agent` variable is properly defined and updated with an appropriate user agent string for HTTP requests. Also, verify_ssl should be set appropriately based on security requirements.

**Output Example**: 
```
("<!DOCTYPE html><html>...</html>", "text/html")
```

This example shows a typical return value where the HTML content of the page is returned as text and the MIME type is extracted from the response headers. If an error occurs, it might return `(None, None)` to indicate failure in fetching the content.
***
### FunctionDef try_pandoc(self)
**try_pandoc**: The function of try_pandoc is to check if Pandoc is available and install it if necessary.
**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `try_pandoc` method checks the availability of Pandoc, a document conversion tool. If Pandoc is not available (`self.pandoc_available` is False), it attempts to load Pandoc using `pypandoc.get_pandoc_version()`. If this succeeds, it sets `self.pandoc_available` to True and returns without further action.

If loading Pandoc fails due to an `OSError`, the method tries to download Pandoc via `pypandoc.download_pandoc(delete_installer=True)`. This attempt is wrapped in a try-except block to handle any exceptions that may arise during the installation process. If downloading and installing Pandoc fails, it logs the error using `self.print_error` with a message indicating the failure.

Upon successful detection or installation of Pandoc, the method sets `self.pandoc_available` to True, indicating that Pandoc is now available for use.
**Note**: 
- The function assumes that `pypandoc` and related dependencies are correctly installed in the environment.
- It is important to ensure that `print_error` is properly defined within the class to handle any error messages appropriately.
- This method should be called whenever there's a need to check or guarantee the availability of Pandoc, such as when converting HTML content to Markdown.

**Output Example**: 
If Pandoc is already installed and available:
```
No output
self.pandoc_available = True
```

If Pandoc is not available and installation fails:
```
Unable to install pandoc: [Exception details]
```
***
### FunctionDef html_to_markdown(self, page_source)
**html_to_markdown**: The function of `html_to_markdown` is to convert HTML content into Markdown format.

**Parameters**:
· parameter1: page_source (str): A string containing the source code of an HTML document.

**Code Description**: 
The `html_to_markdown` function takes the raw HTML content as input and converts it to a more readable Markdown format. The process involves several steps:

1. **Parsing with BeautifulSoup**: The function first uses the `BeautifulSoup` library to parse the HTML content, creating a BeautifulSoup object (`soup`). This allows for easier manipulation of the HTML structure.

2. **Slimming Down HTML (Calling `slimdown_html`)**: The parsed HTML is passed through the `slimdown_html` function to clean up unnecessary elements and attributes. Specifically, it removes `<svg>` tags, image tags with `src` attributes starting with "data:", and links with `href` attributes starting with "data:". It also simplifies other tags by removing most of their attributes except for `href`.

3. **Converting HTML to Markdown**: If the Pandoc library is available (checked via `self.pandoc_available`), the function uses `pypandoc.convert_text` to convert the cleaned-up HTML content into Markdown format.

4. **Post-Processing**: After conversion, the function performs post-processing steps on the resulting Markdown string:
   - It replaces `<h1>` tags with `#` for headers.
   - It removes any leading whitespace in paragraphs to improve readability.

5. **Returning the Result**: The processed Markdown content is returned as the final output.

**Note**: This function relies on the availability of Pandoc and its Python wrapper `pypandoc`. If Pandoc is not available, it still attempts to convert the HTML using a simpler method but may lose some formatting details.

**Output Example**: 
Given input `<html><body><h1>Test</h1><p>This is HTML content.</p></body></html>`, the function might return:
```
# Test

This is HTML content.
```
***
## FunctionDef slimdown_html(soup)
**slimdown_html**: The function of slimdown_html is to clean up HTML by removing or simplifying certain elements to make the resulting document more manageable.
**Parameters**:
· parameter1: soup (BeautifulSoup): A BeautifulSoup object representing an HTML document.

**Code Description**: 
The `slimdown_html` function processes a BeautifulSoup object (`soup`) to clean it up in several ways. It iterates through all `<svg>` elements and removes them using the `.decompose()` method, effectively deleting these elements from the soup. Next, if any image tags (`<img>`) are present, they too are removed.

The function then targets links with `href` attributes starting with "data:" and removes such tags, as well as tags with `src` attributes that start with "data:", further simplifying the HTML structure by removing potentially large or unnecessary data elements. 

Finally, it iterates through all remaining tags in the soup and simplifies them by removing most of their attributes except for `href`. This step ensures that only essential information is retained while reducing redundancy.

The cleaned-up BeautifulSoup object (`soup`) is then returned, ready for further processing or display.

**Note**: The function assumes the input is a valid BeautifulSoup object. Ensure that the HTML content passed to it is well-formed and parseable by BeautifulSoup.

**Output Example**: If the input soup contains `<svg>` tags, images with `src` attributes starting with "data:", and other tags with unnecessary attributes, the output will be a simplified version of the soup where these elements are removed or their attributes are stripped. For example:
```html
<div href="example.com">
    <p>Some text</p>
</div>
```
becomes
```html
<div href="example.com">
    Some text
</div>
```

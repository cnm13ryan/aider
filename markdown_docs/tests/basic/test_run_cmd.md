## FunctionDef test_run_cmd_echo
**test_run_cmd_echo**: The function of test_run_cmd_echo is to verify that the `run_cmd` function correctly executes an echo command.
**Parameters**:
Â· None

**Code Description**: 
The `test_run_cmd_echo` function tests the functionality of another function, `run_cmd`, which is responsible for executing shell commands. Specifically, it checks if a simple "echo" command works as expected.

1. The function constructs a command string: `"echo Hello, World!"`.
2. It then calls the `run_cmd` function with this command.
3. The `run_cmd` function executes the command and returns both the exit code and the output.
4. The test asserts that:
   - The exit code is 0, indicating successful execution of the command.
   - The output is `"Hello, World!"`, stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that `run_cmd` is correctly implemented to handle simple commands like "echo".
- Verify that the environment where this test runs supports the `echo` command and has a shell available for execution.
- This test assumes that the `run_cmd` function can handle basic string commands without complex arguments or redirections.

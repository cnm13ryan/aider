## ClassDef TestChatSummary
**TestChatSummary**: The function of TestChatSummary is to test various functionalities of the ChatSummary class.
**Code Description**: 
The `TestChatSummary` class inherits from the `TestCase` class and contains several methods to test different aspects of the `ChatSummary` class.

1. **setUp Method**: This method sets up a mock model that simulates the behavior of a real model used in the `ChatSummary` class. It configures the model's name, token counting logic, and other attributes necessary for testing.
2. **test_initialization Method**: This test checks if an instance of `ChatSummary` is correctly initialized with the specified maximum number of tokens (100).
3. **test_too_big Method**: This method tests the behavior of the `too_big` method in `ChatSummary`. It verifies that messages are correctly identified as too large or not based on their token count.
4. **test_tokenize Method**: This test ensures that the `tokenize` method properly tokenizes each message and returns a list of tuples containing the number of tokens and the original message.
5. **test_summarize_all Method**: This method tests the `summarize_all` function, which is responsible for generating summaries from multiple messages. It uses a mock patch to simulate model responses and checks that the summary matches expected output.
6. **test_summarize Method**: This test evaluates the behavior of the `summarize` method by simulating message lists and verifying that it returns an appropriate list of summaries.
7. **test_fallback_to_second_model Method**: This method tests the fallback mechanism in `ChatSummary`. It ensures that if the primary model fails, the secondary model is used to generate a summary.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that all mock models are properly configured and patched before running these tests.
- The tests rely on specific behavior of the `Model` class methods such as `token_count`, `info`, and `simple_send_with_retries`.

**Output Example**: 

For example, when testing `test_summarize_all`, if the input messages are:
```python
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello world"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi there"}
]
```
The expected output might be a summary like:
```python
[
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": (
            "I spoke to you previously about a number of things.\nThis is a summary"
        ),
    }
]
```

### FunctionDef test_initialization(self)
**test_initialization**: The function of `test_initialization` is to ensure that the `Summary` class instance is properly initialized before any other tests are run.
**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `test_initialization` method serves as a setup for testing the behavior of the `Summary` class. It instantiates an object of the `Summary` class and verifies that it can be created without errors, ensuring that all necessary attributes and methods are available for further testing.

In detail:
1. **Class Instantiation**: The function creates an instance of the `Summary` class. This is done to ensure that the class can be instantiated correctly.
2. **Error Handling**: By attempting to instantiate the class, any issues with the constructor or required attributes will be surfaced immediately. If the instantiation fails for any reason (e.g., missing dependencies), a test failure would occur at this point.
3. **Dependency Verification**: The function indirectly verifies that all dependencies required by the `Summary` class are correctly set up and functional.

This method is crucial because it acts as a baseline check to ensure that subsequent tests can proceed without encountering issues related to improper initialization of the class under test.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that all necessary modules and classes (e.g., `prompts`, `simple_send_with_retries`, etc.) are correctly imported before running this test.
- This test should be run first in any suite of tests for the `Summary` class to catch any initialization issues early.
***
### FunctionDef test_too_big(self)
**test_too_big**: The function of `test_too_big` is to verify the behavior of the `too_big` method when evaluating whether a list of messages exceeds a predefined maximum token limit.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: `self`: A reference to the current instance of the class, which contains the `chat_summary` and `max_tokens` attributes.
· parameter2: `messages`: A list of dictionaries representing chat messages, where each dictionary contains "role" and "content" keys.

**Code Description**: The function `test_too_big` is designed to test the `too_big` method by providing it with different sets of messages and verifying its output against expected results. Here’s a detailed analysis:

- **Setup Test Cases**: 
  - Two short messages are first provided as input, and the function checks whether these messages do not exceed the maximum token limit using `self.assertFalse(self.chat_summary.too_big(messages))`.
  - A single long message is then created by joining 101 "word" strings together. This test case ensures that the method correctly identifies a message exceeding the token limit as `True` with `self.assertTrue(self.chat_summary.too_big([long_message]))`.

- **Evaluation of `too_big` Method**:
  - The `too_big` method is called within both test cases to evaluate whether the total number of tokens in the provided messages exceeds the predefined maximum token limit (`max_tokens`).
  - For the short message case, since the total token count does not exceed `max_tokens`, the method should return `False`.
  - For the long message case, the constructed message has a high likelihood of exceeding `max_tokens`, thus the method should return `True`.

**Note**: Ensure that the `tokenize` and `max_tokens` methods are correctly implemented in your class. The `max_tokens` attribute must be properly set to reflect the maximum allowable token count for messages.

This testing function helps ensure that the `too_big` method accurately determines whether a list of messages exceeds the token limit, which is crucial for managing chat summaries and messages efficiently within the system.
***
### FunctionDef test_tokenize(self)
**test_tokenize**: The function of `test_tokenize` is to verify that the `tokenize` method correctly tokenizes chat messages.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: `self`: A reference to the current instance of the class, allowing access to its methods and attributes.

**Code Description**: 
The function `test_tokenize` tests the functionality of the `tokenize` method by providing a list of chat messages and comparing the tokenized output with expected results. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Setup Test Data**: The test data consists of two dictionaries, each representing a chat message with "role" and "content" keys.
2. **Invoke Tokenization Method**: The `tokenize` method of the current class instance is called with the list of messages as input. This method processes the messages to generate tokenized pairs.
3. **Assertion Check**: The result of the `tokenize` method is stored in the variable `tokenized`. An assertion check using `self.assertEqual` ensures that the output matches the expected result, which consists of tuples where each tuple contains the number of tokens and the original message.

This test function plays a crucial role in validating the correctness of the tokenization process. It helps ensure that messages are accurately converted into tokenized pairs before further processing or analysis.

**Note**: Ensure that the `token_count` method exists within the same class and correctly calculates the number of tokens for each message. The `max_tokens` attribute should also be defined appropriately to handle different scenarios in your application.
***
### FunctionDef test_summarize_all(self, mock_send)
**test_summarize_all**: The function of `test_summarize_all` is to verify that the `summarize_all` method generates accurate summaries from given messages.
**parameters**:
· mock_send: A mock object used to simulate sending requests to AI models.

**Code Description**: 
The `test_summarize_all` method tests the functionality of the `summarize_all` method within the `ChatSummary` class. It does this by setting up a mock scenario where messages are provided, and then checking whether the generated summary matches the expected output.
1. **Mock Setup**: The `mock_send` parameter is configured to return a predefined string "This is a summary" when called.
2. **Message Preparation**: A list of two message dictionaries is created, each containing a user or assistant role and corresponding content.
3. **Summary Generation**: The `summarize_all` method of the `chat_summary` object is invoked with the prepared messages as input.
4. **Assertion Check**: Using an assertion (`self.assertEqual`), it verifies that the generated summary matches the expected output, which includes a user message combining previous interactions and the provided summary.

This test ensures that the `summarize_all` method correctly processes multiple messages to generate a coherent summary, integrating both user and assistant contributions. The use of mocking helps isolate the functionality being tested from external dependencies like network requests or specific model implementations.

**Note**: Ensure that the mock object is properly configured before calling the `summarize_all` method to avoid unexpected behavior during testing. Also, be aware that the test assumes a specific format for the expected summary output.

**Output Example**: 
The test will pass if the generated summary matches:
```python
[
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": (
            "I spoke to you previously about a number of things.\nThis is a summary"
        ),
    }
]
```
***
### FunctionDef test_summarize(self)
**test_summarize**: The function of `test_summarize` is to verify that the `summarize` method of `ChatSummary` correctly handles different message lengths and depths.
**Parameters**: 
· messages: A list of messages to be summarized, where each message is a dictionary containing at least a "role" key indicating its role (e.g., "assistant", "user").
· depth: An optional integer representing the recursion level for summarization. Defaults to 0.

**Code Description**: The `test_summarize` function serves as a test case for the `summarize` method of the `ChatSummary` class, which is responsible for breaking down and summarizing long conversations into manageable parts based on token counts and message roles. Here’s a detailed analysis:

1. **Initial Check for Models Availability**: The first step in the `test_summarize` function checks if any models are available for summarization. If no models are available, it raises a `ValueError`. This ensures that the method cannot proceed without necessary resources.

2. **Token Counting and Depth Check**: It calculates the total number of tokens required to represent all messages using the `tokenize` method. If the total token count is within the allowed limit (`self.max_tokens`) and the current depth is 0, it returns the original list of messages, indicating that no further summarization is needed.

3. **Splitting Strategy**: The function employs a strategy to split the message list into head and tail parts based on token counts:
   - If the number of messages is too small or if the recursion depth exceeds a certain limit (3), it directly calls `summarize_all` to summarize all messages.
   - It iterates over the messages in reverse order, accumulating tokens until reaching half of the maximum allowed tokens (`self.max_tokens // 2`). This helps ensure that both parts have roughly equal token counts.

4. **Ensuring Proper Head Split**: The function ensures that the head part ends with an assistant message by adjusting the split index if necessary. This is crucial for maintaining context and coherence in summaries.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**: If the selected split point results in a too small head, it falls back to summarizing all messages using `summarize_all`.

6. **Recursive Summarization**: The function recursively summarizes the head part of the message list and combines it with the tail part. It checks if the combined summary fits within the token limit; otherwise, it continues to summarize the result further.

7. **Model Token Constraints**: The function considers model-specific constraints by adjusting input tokens accordingly, ensuring that each summarized chunk does not exceed the maximum allowed input size for models.

**Note**: The `test_summarize` function is designed to handle complex scenarios where messages are split and summarized multiple times until they fit within token limits. It ensures that summaries maintain context and coherence while adhering to model constraints.

**Output Example**: The output of `test_summarize` could be a list of messages representing the final summary, which may include both head and tail parts after recursive summarization. For example:
```python
[
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Summary of first part..."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "..."},
    ...
]
```
This output is a combination of summarized messages from the head and any remaining messages in the tail, ensuring that the total token count does not exceed the allowed limit.

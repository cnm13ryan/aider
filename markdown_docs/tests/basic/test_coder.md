This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the `CustomerProfile` object, including its fields, operations, and constraints. For more detailed information or specific use cases, please refer to our API reference guide.
#### FunctionDef mock_send
**mock_send**: The function of mock_send is to simulate sending data and prepare partial responses.
**parameters**: 
· args: A tuple containing any additional positional arguments passed to the function.
· kwargs: A dictionary containing any additional keyword arguments passed to the function.

**Code Description**: This function primarily serves as a mock implementation for simulating the process of sending data. It does not actually send anything but prepares the state of an object named `coder` by setting its attributes. Specifically, it sets two attributes:
- `partial_response_content`: This attribute is assigned the string "ok", indicating that a partial response content has been set.
- `partial_response_function_call`: This attribute is set to an empty dictionary, suggesting that any function calls related to this partial response are also initialized.

The return value of this function is always an empty list (`[]`), which could be used in testing scenarios where the expected output from a send operation needs to be an empty collection.

**Note**: Since `mock_send` is designed for simulation purposes, it does not interact with actual external systems or services. Developers should ensure that all necessary attributes are properly initialized before calling this function. Additionally, if the `coder` object's state changes in other parts of the codebase, developers may need to adjust the initialization logic accordingly.

**Output Example**: The return value will always be an empty list: `[]`.

#### FunctionDef mock_send
**mock_send**: The function of mock_send is to initialize partial response settings in the coder instance.
**parameters**: 
· No parameters are defined for this function.

**Code Description**: The `mock_send` function does not accept any arguments and directly modifies the properties of an instance named `coder`. Specifically, it sets two attributes:
- `partial_response_content` to "ok", which likely indicates a successful or default response content.
- `partial_response_function_call` to an empty dictionary, suggesting that no additional function calls are expected for this mock scenario.

This function is typically used in testing scenarios where the behavior of sending data needs to be simulated without actually making network requests. By setting these attributes, it prepares the coder instance to return a predefined response and indicates the absence of further function calls during the test.

**Note**: Ensure that `coder` is properly instantiated before calling `mock_send`. Also, this function should only be used in testing contexts as it directly modifies internal state without any return value or side effects outside the tested environment.

**Output Example**: The function does not return a value; instead, it updates the properties of the `coder` instance. After invoking `mock_send`, the following changes occur:
- `coder.partial_response_content` will be set to "ok".
- `coder.partial_response_function_call` will become an empty dictionary `{}`.

#### FunctionDef mock_send
**mock_send**: The function of mock_send is to simulate sending data by updating coder's partial response content and setting up a function call dictionary.
**parameters**: 
· args: A variable-length argument list that can be used to pass any number of positional arguments to the function.
· kwargs: A dictionary-like object containing keyword arguments, allowing for named parameters in addition to positional ones.

**Code Description**: The mock_send function is designed to mimic the behavior of sending data by updating two attributes of an instance called coder. Specifically, it sets the partial_response_content attribute of coder with a formatted string that includes file name information and marks content changes using Git-like syntax (SEARCH, REPLACE). Additionally, it initializes the partial_response_function_call attribute as an empty dictionary.

The function does not return any value; instead, it returns an empty list `[]`. This could be used in test scenarios where the focus is on how data or attributes are modified rather than the actual return values of a function call.

**Note**: 
- The function assumes that coder is already defined and accessible within its scope. Ensure that the coder instance has the appropriate attributes set up before calling this method.
- The string formatting used in `partial_response_content` includes placeholders for file name (`fname`) which should be provided as part of the test setup or dynamically generated during testing.

**Output Example**: 
```python
# Assuming fname is 'example.txt'
mock_send(fname='example.txt')

# After execution, coder.partial_response_content would look like:

example.txt
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
new
>>>>>>> REPLACE

"""

# And coder.partial_response_function_call will be set to an empty dictionary.
```

#### FunctionDef mock_send
**mock_send**: The function of mock_send is to simulate sending data by updating the coder's response content.
**parameters**: 
· args: A variable-length argument list that allows passing any number of positional arguments to the function.
· kwargs: A variable-length keyword argument dictionary that allows passing any number of named arguments to the function.

**Code Description**: The mock_send function updates two attributes of the coder object: `partial_response_content` and `partial_response_function_call`. 

1. It sets `coder.partial_response_content` to a formatted string that includes a file name (`fname2`) and a code comparison context, where "two" is marked as the original content (indicated by the `<<<<<<<< SEARCH` section) and "TWO" is shown as the new content (marked by the `>>>>>>> REPLACE` section).
2. It initializes `coder.partial_response_function_call` as an empty dictionary.
3. The function returns an empty list.

This mock function is likely used in testing scenarios to simulate the behavior of sending data or responses, particularly when dealing with file changes and version control comparisons.

**Note**: Ensure that the `fname2` variable is properly defined elsewhere in your code before calling this function. Also, be aware that modifying these attributes directly can affect other parts of the test or application logic.

**Output Example**: Mocking a possible return value:
```python
mock_send()
# Assuming fname2 is 'example.txt'
coder.partial_response_content = """
Do this:

example.txt
<<<<<<< SEARCH
two
=======
TWO
>>>>>>> REPLACE
"""
coder.partial_response_function_call = {}
return_value = []
```
***
#### FunctionDef mock_get_commit_message(diffs, context)
**mock_get_commit_message**: The function of mock_get_commit_message is to return a predefined commit message while ensuring certain conditions are met.
**parameters**:
· diffs: A list or set containing strings that need to be checked against specific patterns.
· context: An optional parameter, typically used for additional context or setup but not utilized in the current implementation.

**Code Description**: The function mock_get_commit_message is designed to simulate a commit message retrieval process. It first checks if the string "one" or its uppercase version "ONE" exists within the diffs list. If either of these strings are found, it raises an assertion error using self.assertNotIn(). This ensures that the diffs do not contain any forbidden patterns before proceeding. After passing this check, the function returns a predefined commit message: "commit message".

**Note**: The function assumes the presence of 'self' as an implicit parameter, which is typical in test cases within classes. Ensure that the context parameter remains unused unless required for future enhancements or additional tests.

**Output Example**: If no forbidden patterns ("one" or "ONE") are found in diffs, the function returns "commit message". Example usage: `mock_get_commit_message(["two", "three"], {})` would return "commit message".

#### FunctionDef mock_send
**mock_send**: The function of mock_send is to simulate sending data and update the coder's partial response content and function call.
**parameters**: 
· args: A tuple containing additional positional arguments (if any).
· kwargs: A dictionary containing additional keyword arguments (if any).

**Code Description**: 
The `mock_send` function simulates a send operation by updating the `partial_response_content` attribute of an instance of the `coder` class. It appends a specific string to this content, which includes instructions and changes in a code-like format. Additionally, it sets the `partial_response_function_call` attribute of the `coder` instance to an empty dictionary.

1. The function starts by constructing a string that includes a message instructing the coder to perform certain actions on a file named `fname`. This string is then assigned to the `partial_response_content` attribute of the `coder` object.
2. It uses f-strings and conditional markers (<<<<<<< SEARCH, =======, >>>>>>> REPLACE) typical in merge conflict scenarios to indicate where changes should be made.
3. The function also sets the `partial_response_function_call` attribute to an empty dictionary, which might represent a placeholder for future function calls or actions that need to be executed.

**Note**: Ensure that the `coder` instance has attributes named `partial_response_content` and `partial_response_function_call`. These attributes must be defined in the class definition of `coder`.

**Output Example**: The output of this function is not explicitly returned but rather affects the state of the coder object. However, a possible scenario could look like:

```python
# Assuming the coder instance has been initialized with partial_response_content and partial_response_function_call attributes.
mock_send(fname="example_file.txt")

# After calling mock_send:
coder.partial_response_content = """
Do this:

example_file.txt
<<<<<<< SEARCH
two
=======
three
>>>>>>> REPLACE
"""
coder.partial_response_function_call = {}
```

#### FunctionDef mock_get_commit_message(diffs, context)
**mock_get_commit_message**: The function of mock_get_commit_message is to simulate the process of getting a commit message based on file differences and context.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: diffs (List[Dict[str, str]]): A list of dictionaries representing file differences, where each dictionary contains information about changes in files, such as file paths and content differences.
· parameter2: context (str): Additional context or metadata that may be relevant to the commit message generation.

**Code Description**: The function `mock_get_commit_message` is designed for testing purposes. It takes two parameters: a list of dictionaries representing file differences (`diffs`) and additional context (`context`). The function appends the provided differences to a predefined list named `saved_diffs`, which suggests that this function might be part of a larger test suite tracking changes made during tests. Regardless of the input, it always returns the string "commit message", simulating a commit message that could be used in automated testing scenarios.

**Note**: 
- The function is intended for use within a testing environment where realistic commit messages need to be generated without requiring actual Git commands.
- Ensure that `saved_diffs` is properly initialized before calling this function, otherwise the appended differences may not be tracked correctly.
- The context parameter can be used to pass any relevant information needed during the test but does not affect the output.

**Output Example**: The function will always return "commit message". For example:
```python
# Sample usage in a test case
mock_get_commit_message([{'file_path': 'test_file.py', 'changes': 'renamed'}, {'file_path': 'config.yaml', 'changes': 'updated'}], "Test commit for file changes")
```
Output: `"commit message"`

The `UserAuthenticationService` is a critical component within our application's security framework designed to handle user authentication processes securely and efficiently. It provides essential functionalities such as user login, logout, password reset, and session management.

#### Key Features
- **User Login**: Facilitates secure user authentication through username and password validation.
- **Password Reset**: Allows users to request a password reset via email or other specified methods.
- **Session Management**: Manages active sessions for logged-in users, ensuring security and preventing unauthorized access.
- **Logout Functionality**: Provides an endpoint for logging out the current user session.

#### Methods

##### `login(username: string, password: string): Promise<UserToken>`
**Description:** Authenticates a user by verifying their username and password against the stored credentials. Upon successful authentication, it returns a token that can be used to access protected resources.

- **Parameters:**
  - `username (string)`: The unique identifier for the user.
  - `password (string)`: The user's password in plaintext or hashed form.

- **Returns:**
  - `Promise<UserToken>`: A promise that resolves with a token if authentication is successful, otherwise rejects with an error message.

##### `logout(token: string): Promise<void>`
**Description:** Logs out the current session associated with the provided token. This method invalidates the token and ends the user's active session.

- **Parameters:**
  - `token (string)`: The token representing the current user’s session.

- **Returns:**
  - `Promise<void>`: A promise that resolves when the logout process is complete, or rejects with an error if the token is invalid or expired.

##### `resetPassword(email: string): Promise<string>`
**Description:** Initiates a password reset request for the specified email address. This method sends a password reset link to the user's registered email.

- **Parameters:**
  - `email (string)`: The user’s email address associated with their account.

- **Returns:**
  - `Promise<string>`: A promise that resolves with a confirmation message or an error if the email is not found or there are issues sending the reset link.

##### `validateToken(token: string): Promise<UserProfile>`
**Description:** Validates the provided token to ensure it is valid and has not expired. If successful, it returns the user profile information associated with the token.

- **Parameters:**
  - `token (string)`: The token to be validated.

- **Returns:**
  - `Promise<UserProfile>`: A promise that resolves with the user’s profile details if the token is valid, or rejects with an error message if the token is invalid or has expired.

#### Security Considerations
- All communication between the client and server must use HTTPS to ensure data security.
- Passwords should never be stored in plaintext; always hash them using secure algorithms like bcrypt.
- Tokens should have a limited lifespan and be invalidated upon logout or expiration.
- Implement rate limiting on login attempts to prevent brute force attacks.

#### Usage Example
```typescript
// Login example
const userToken = await UserAuthenticationService.login('john.doe@example.com', 'securepassword123');
console.log(userToken);

// Logout example
await UserAuthenticationService.logout(userToken);
```

#### Dependencies
- `bcrypt`: For secure password hashing and comparison.
- `jsonwebtoken`: For generating and validating tokens.

#### Maintenance and Support
For any issues or questions regarding the `UserAuthenticationService`, please contact the IT support team at [support@company.com]. Regular updates and patches will be provided to ensure the service remains robust and secure.
#### FunctionDef mock_send
**mock_send**: The function of `mock_send` is to simulate sending a message or request, setting up partial response content and function call attributes for further processing.
**parameters**: 
· args: A variable-length argument list that can be used to pass additional positional arguments if needed.
· kwargs: A dictionary of keyword arguments that can be used to pass additional parameters as key-value pairs.

**Code Description**: The `mock_send` function is designed to mock the sending process, which is typically used in testing scenarios. It does not actually send any message but sets up a partial response content and a function call attribute for the `coder` object.
- Firstly, it updates the `partial_response_content` attribute of the `coder` object with a string that includes instructions to modify an existing file named `fname`. The content suggests replacing "one" with "two".
- Secondly, it initializes the `partial_response_function_call` attribute of the `coder` object as an empty dictionary. This is likely used to store additional details about the function call required for further processing.
- Finally, it returns an empty list, indicating that no actual message or data was sent.

**Note**: When using this function in tests, ensure that the `coder` object and its attributes are properly set up before calling `mock_send`. Also, verify that the file name `fname` is correctly specified to avoid any confusion during testing.
**Output Example**: The output of `mock_send` would be an empty list: `[]`. Additionally, the `partial_response_content` attribute of the `coder` object will be updated with a string indicating the intended change in the file, and the `partial_response_function_call` attribute will be initialized as an empty dictionary.
***
#### FunctionDef mock_get_commit_message(diffs, context)
**mock_get_commit_message**: The function of mock_get_commit_message is to simulate the retrieval of a commit message based on given diffs and context.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: diffs - A list or collection of file differences that need to be committed.
· parameter2: context - Additional contextual information required for generating the commit message.

**Code Description**: The function `mock_get_commit_message` is designed to mimic the behavior of getting a commit message when performing operations on files. It accepts two parameters:
- `diffs`: This parameter represents the differences between the current state and the desired state of files that need to be committed. These differences could include additions, deletions, or modifications made to the files.
- `context`: An optional parameter providing additional context such as file paths, specific lines modified, or other relevant information that can influence the commit message.

The function appends the provided diffs to a list named `saved_diffs` and returns a fixed string "commit message". This mock implementation is useful for testing scenarios where the exact commit message isn't critical but the process of committing changes needs to be verified.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that `saved_diffs` is defined as a global or accessible within the scope from where this function is called.
- The return value is always "commit message", which does not change based on input parameters. This simplifies testing by providing a consistent output.

**Output Example**: The function will always return:
```
"commit message"
```

#### FunctionDef mock_send
**mock_send**: The function of mock_send is to simulate sending data from a coder instance.
**parameters**: 
· args: A variable-length argument list that can be passed to the function but is not used within it.
· kwargs: A dictionary of keyword arguments that can also be passed but are not utilized in this function.

**Code Description**: The `mock_send` function serves as a mock implementation for sending data or commands from an instance of the `coder` class. It updates two attributes of the coder object:
- `partial_response_content`: This attribute is set to a string containing a shell command and its expected output.
- `partial_response_function_call`: This attribute is initialized as an empty dictionary, indicating that no specific function call was made during this mock send operation.

The function returns an empty list, signifying that it does not return any meaningful data but focuses on modifying the state of the coder object for testing purposes. The shell command provided in `partial_response_content` is intended to demonstrate a simple echo command and its expected output, which can be used as part of a test scenario or mock interaction.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that it is called within a context where the `coder` instance has been properly initialized and configured. The attributes `partial_response_content` and `partial_response_function_call` are specific to the testing framework and should be reset or handled appropriately after each test case if they need to be reused in subsequent tests.

**Output Example**: 
```python
mock_send()
# After calling mock_send, the coder instance will have its attributes updated as follows:
coder.partial_response_content = "Here's a shell command to run:\n\n```bash\necho \"Hello, World!\"\n```\nThis command will print 'Hello, World!' to the console."
coder.partial_response_function_call = {}
# The return value of mock_send is an empty list: []
```

#### FunctionDef mock_send
**mock_send**: The function of mock_send is to simulate sending data or commands.
**parameters**: 
· args: Variable length argument list (optional)
· kwargs: Arbitrary keyword arguments (optional)

**Code Description**: The `mock_send` function is designed to mimic the behavior of sending data or commands in a testing environment. It sets specific attributes on an object named `coder`, prepares a partial response content, and returns an empty list.

- **Setting Attributes**: Inside the function, it first updates two attributes of the `coder` object:
  - `partial_response_content`: This attribute is set to a string that includes a shell command for running. The command `echo "Hello, World!"` prints 'Hello, World!' to the console.
  - `partial_response_function_call`: This attribute is initialized as an empty dictionary.

- **Returning Value**: After setting the attributes, the function returns an empty list `[]`. This return value could be used for assertions or further processing in test cases.

**Note**: The use of this function should be confined to testing scenarios where shell commands and partial responses need to be mocked. Ensure that the object `coder` is properly initialized before calling `mock_send`.

**Output Example**: 
```python
# Mocked output when `mock_send` is called
mock_send()
# After the call, the following attributes are set on coder:
# coder.partial_response_content = "Here's a shell command to run:\n\n```bash\necho \"Hello, World!\"\n```\nThis command will print 'Hello, World!' to the console."
# coder.partial_response_function_call = {}
# The function returns: []
```

### FunctionDef test_show_exhausted_error(self)
### Object: UserAuthenticationService

#### Overview
The `UserAuthenticationService` is a critical component of the application responsible for managing user authentication processes. It ensures that users can securely log in to the system and access their accounts while maintaining data integrity and security.

#### Responsibilities
- **User Login**: Handles the login process, including validation of credentials.
- **Token Generation**: Issues secure tokens (e.g., JWT) upon successful authentication.
- **Session Management**: Manages user sessions by tracking active users and their permissions.
- **Password Reset**: Facilitates password reset requests through email verification.

#### Interface
```java
public interface UserAuthenticationService {

    /**
     * Authenticates a user based on provided credentials.
     *
     * @param username The username of the user.
     * @param password The password of the user.
     * @return A boolean indicating whether the authentication was successful.
     */
    boolean authenticateUser(String username, String password);

    /**
     * Generates and returns a JWT token for the authenticated user.
     *
     * @param userId The unique identifier of the user.
     * @return A JSON Web Token (JWT) representing the user's session.
     */
    String generateToken(Long userId);

    /**
     * Validates an email reset request and sends a password reset link to the user.
     *
     * @param email The email address associated with the user account.
     * @return A boolean indicating whether the reset request was successfully sent.
     */
    boolean sendPasswordResetEmail(String email);

    /**
     * Updates the user's password based on the reset token and new password provided.
     *
     * @param resetToken The token used to identify the reset request.
     * @param newPassword The new password for the user account.
     * @return A boolean indicating whether the password update was successful.
     */
    boolean updatePasswordWithResetToken(String resetToken, String newPassword);
}
```

#### Usage Example
```java
public class AuthenticationExample {

    private final UserAuthenticationService authService;

    public AuthenticationExample(UserAuthenticationService authService) {
        this.authService = authService;
    }

    /**
     * Demonstrates the process of authenticating a user and generating a token.
     */
    void authenticateAndGenerateToken() {
        boolean loginSuccess = authService.authenticateUser("john_doe", "password123");
        if (loginSuccess) {
            String token = authService.generateToken(1L);
            System.out.println("Authentication successful. Token: " + token);
        } else {
            System.err.println("Login failed.");
        }
    }

    /**
     * Illustrates the process of requesting a password reset and updating it.
     */
    void requestAndChangePassword() {
        boolean sendSuccess = authService.sendPasswordResetEmail("john_doe@example.com");
        if (sendSuccess) {
            String token = "example_reset_token";
            boolean updateSuccess = authService.updatePasswordWithResetToken(token, "new_password123");
            if (updateSuccess) {
                System.out.println("Password reset successful.");
            } else {
                System.err.println("Failed to change password.");
            }
        } else {
            System.err.println("Failed to send password reset email.");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Notes
- **Security**: Ensure that all credentials and tokens are handled securely, following best practices for encryption and token validation.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to manage authentication failures gracefully.

This documentation provides a clear understanding of the `UserAuthenticationService` interface and its methods, along with practical usage examples.

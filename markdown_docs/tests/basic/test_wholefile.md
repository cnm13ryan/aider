### FunctionDef tearDown(self)
**tearDown**: The function of tearDown is to revert the working directory and clean up temporary directories created during testing.

**parameters**:
Â· self: This parameter refers to the instance of the TestWholeFileCoder class itself.

**Code Description**: 
The `tearDown` method is responsible for cleaning up any resources that were set up during testing. Specifically, it performs two main tasks:

- **Reverting Working Directory**: The first line `os.chdir(self.original_cwd)` changes the current working directory back to its original state (`self.original_cwd`). This ensures that after running tests, the system returns to a known and clean state. Typically, this is used when the test modifies files or directories in the current working directory.

- **Cleaning Up Temporary Directories**: The second line `shutil.rmtree(self.tempdir, ignore_errors=True)` removes the temporary directory (`self.tempdir`) created during testing. The `ignore_errors=True` parameter ensures that any errors encountered during removal (such as if the directory is still in use) are ignored, allowing the test to complete without interruption.

This method helps maintain a consistent environment between tests and prevents side effects from one test affecting another. By ensuring the working directory is reset and all temporary files are removed, `tearDown` supports reliable and isolated testing conditions.

**Note**: Ensure that `self.original_cwd` contains the correct path before running any tests to avoid issues with directory changes. Also, make sure that `self.tempdir` accurately points to the temporary directory created during test setup to ensure thorough cleanup.

#### FunctionDef mock_send
**mock_send**: The function of mock_send is to prepare partial responses and function calls for a coder instance.
**parameters**: 
Â· *args: A variable number of positional arguments which are not used in this function.
Â· **kwargs: A variable number of keyword arguments which are not used in this function.
**Code Description**: 
The `mock_send` function prepares the response content and function call details for a coder instance. It sets the `partial_response_content` attribute of the coder to include instructions for performing an action, along with the name of a file and its new content. Additionally, it clears any existing partial response function calls by setting `partial_response_function_call` to an empty dictionary. The function returns an empty list.
The specific steps are as follows:
1. It constructs a string that includes a message instructing the coder to perform an action on a specified file with updated content.
2. This constructed string is assigned to `coder.partial_response_content`.
3. It clears any previous function calls by setting `coder.partial_response_function_call` to an empty dictionary.
4. The function returns an empty list, indicating that no actual data or actions are being returned from this mock method.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the coder instance has been properly initialized before calling this function.
- This function is typically used in testing scenarios where partial responses and function calls need to be mocked for a coder object.
- The `new_content` variable should be defined elsewhere in your code or passed as part of the kwargs if needed.

**Output Example**: 
If `file1` is a file named "example.txt" and `new_content` is "Updated content", then the output might look like:
```
Do this:

example.txt
```
```python
Updated content
```

This example would be assigned to `coder.partial_response_content`.

# Execute a simple query and fetch results as dictionaries
results = db_manager.execute_query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 18")
for row in results:
    print(row)

# Execute multiple queries within a transaction
queries = [
    ("INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES (?, ?)", ('Alice', 25)),
    ("UPDATE users SET status='active' WHERE name='Bob'")
]
db_manager.execute_transaction(queries)

# Disconnect from the database

To log in a user, call the `login()` method with the provided username and password. This method will validate the credentials against the UMS and return a session token if successful.

```java
String username = "testuser";
String password = "securepassword123";

try {
    String token = authService.login(username, password);
    System.out.println("Login successful! Token: " + token);
} catch (AuthenticationException e) {
    System.err.println("Failed to authenticate user: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

##### Logout Functionality
To log out a user, call the `logout()` method with their session token. This will invalidate the token and end the user's session.

```java
String token = "valid-session-token";
try {
    authService.logout(token);
    System.out.println("User logged out successfully.");
} catch (InvalidTokenException e) {
    System.err.println("Failed to log out user: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

##### Error Handling
The `UserAuthenticationService` throws specific exceptions for different error scenarios. These include:

- **AuthenticationException**: Thrown when the provided credentials are invalid.

## ClassDef PrintCalled
**PrintCalled**: The function of PrintCalled is to serve as a custom exception class that can be raised when a print statement has been called.
**Attributes**: This Class does not define any attributes; it inherits from the base `Exception` class and only provides functionality for raising an exception.

**Code Description**: 
The code defines a class named `PrintCalled`, which is derived from Python's built-in `Exception` class. The primary purpose of this class is to indicate that a specific condition—namely, the execution of a print statement—has occurred or needs to be handled in some way. By raising an instance of `PrintCalled`, developers can signal that a particular action (such as logging or conditional processing) should take place when a print statement is encountered.

The class implementation consists solely of a single line:
```python
class PrintCalled(Exception):
    pass
```
- **Single Line Implementation**: The use of `pass` indicates that this class does not contain any additional methods or attributes beyond what it inherits from the base `Exception` class. This minimalistic approach suggests that the primary purpose is to serve as a marker for certain conditions in the code.

**Note**: 
- Users should be aware that raising an instance of `PrintCalled` can be useful in scenarios where they need to distinguish between different types of exceptions or handle specific situations related to print statements.
- Since this class does not provide any additional functionality, it is primarily used as a placeholder for custom exception handling logic. Developers might consider extending its functionality if more detailed behavior is required.
## ClassDef TestSendChat
**TestSendChat**: The function of TestSendChat is to test various aspects of chat functionality using mock data and error handling.

**attributes**:
· `mock_messages`: A list containing a mock message dictionary with a user role and content.
· `mock_model`: A string representing the mock model name, set to "gpt-4".

**Code Description**: The TestSendChat class contains several test methods designed to validate different scenarios related to chat functionality. This includes testing exceptions, retries for rate limit errors, basic send completion operations, handling functions in the message payload, and dealing with non-retryable errors.

1. **test_litellm_exceptions**: This method tests the behavior of loading exceptions from the LiteLLMExceptions class.
2. **test_simple_send_with_retries_rate_limit_error**: This test simulates a rate limit error during the send process and verifies that retries are handled correctly, asserting that the print function is called three times.
3. **test_send_completion_basic**: This method tests the basic functionality of sending completion requests without any additional functions, ensuring that the mock response is returned and the completion API is called exactly once.
4. **test_send_completion_with_functions**: Here, a test case checks how the system handles functions included in the message payload by verifying if these functions are correctly passed to the completion API call.
5. **test_simple_send_attribute_error**: This method tests the behavior when an attribute error occurs during the send process and confirms that the result is `None`.
6. **test_simple_send_non_retryable_error**: Finally, this test evaluates how the system handles non-retryable errors by ensuring that no retries occur and that only one print statement is executed.

**Note**: When using these tests, ensure that all necessary mock data and side effects are correctly set up to simulate real-world scenarios accurately. Pay special attention to the error handling mechanisms as they play a crucial role in determining the behavior of the chat functionality under different conditions.

**Output Example**: The output will primarily consist of assertions within each test method confirming that the expected behaviors occur, such as the correct number of calls to the print function or the specific attributes being set on mock objects. No direct return values are returned by these tests; they rely on Python's built-in `assert` statements for validation.
### FunctionDef setUp(self)
**setUp**: The function of setUp is to initialize test data and mock objects before each test method runs.
**parameters**: This Function takes no parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `setUp` method initializes two key pieces of data that are used throughout the testing process:
· parameter1: self.mock_messages - A list containing a single dictionary representing a user message. The dictionary has a "role" key set to "user" and a "content" key with the value "Hello".
· parameter2: self.mock_model - A string variable set to "gpt-4", which likely represents a mock model name used in testing scenarios.

This method is typically part of a test suite, where it sets up the necessary environment for each individual test case. By initializing these variables here, the tests can rely on consistent and controlled inputs without having to define them repeatedly within each test function.
**Note**: Ensure that any changes made during the `setUp` process do not affect other test methods or subsequent `setUp` calls. Each test should start with a clean state. Additionally, consider using context managers or teardown methods if you need to clean up resources after tests are run.
***
### FunctionDef test_litellm_exceptions(self)
**test_litellm_exceptions**: The function of test_litellm_exceptions is to verify that exceptions from the `litellm` module are correctly loaded into the `LiteLLMExceptions` class.

**parameters**: 
· parameter1: self

**Code Description**: This method tests the `_load` method of the `LiteLLMExceptions` class by setting the `strict` parameter to `True`. The purpose is to ensure that all exceptions defined in the `litellm` module are properly registered and can be handled within the `LiteLLMExceptions` class.

1. **Initialization**: An instance of `LiteLLMExceptions` is created, which internally calls the `_load` method with `strict=True`.
2. **Loading Exceptions**: The `_load` method iterates through all attributes in the `litellm` module. For each attribute that ends with "Error", it checks if this exception has a corresponding entry in the `EXCEPTIONS` list.
3. **Strict Mode**: When `strict=True`, if an exception from `litellm` is not found in the `EXCEPTIONS` list, a `ValueError` is raised, indicating that the necessary exceptions are missing or misnamed.
4. **Exception Registration**: If the exception exists in the `EXCEPTIONS` list, its information (stored as `ex_info`) is registered with the corresponding class in the `LiteLLMExceptions.exceptions` dictionary.

This test ensures that all critical exceptions from the `litellm` module are properly recognized and can be managed within the `LiteLLMExceptions` system. It helps maintain robust error handling by ensuring no unexpected exceptions go unregistered, which could lead to runtime errors or misbehaving code.

**Note**: Ensure that the `EXCEPTIONS` list is up-to-date with any new additions in the `litellm` module. When running this test, setting `strict=True` can help catch missing exception definitions early in development.

### FunctionDef test_simple_send_with_retries_rate_limit_error(self, mock_print, mock_completion)
**test_simple_send_with_retries_rate_limit_error**: The function of `test_simple_send_with_retries_rate_limit_error` is to test the retry mechanism when encountering rate limit errors during message sending.

**Parameters**:
· mock_print: A mock object for capturing print statements.
· mock_completion: A mock object simulating API completion responses and exceptions.

**Code Description**: 
The function `test_simple_send_with_retries_rate_limit_error` tests the behavior of the `simple_send_with_retries` method when it encounters a rate limit error. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Mock Setup**: The function starts by setting up a mock object (`mock`) to simulate an API response with a status code of 500, indicating an internal server error.

2. **Rate Limit Error Simulation**: A side effect is set on the `mock_completion` mock object to raise a `litellm.RateLimitError`. This error simulates a rate limit being exceeded. The `side_effect` is configured to trigger this exception twice with increasing retry delays, and then stop retrying after the second attempt.

3. **Retry Mechanism Testing**: 
   - During the first attempt, the function prints the error message.
   - After a delay of 0.125 seconds (default retry delay), it retries due to the rate limit error.
   - The retry delay is doubled for each subsequent attempt, up to a maximum of `RETRY_TIMEOUT` seconds.

4. **Error Handling**: 
   - If the retry mechanism fails after two attempts, the function returns `None`.
   - The function also handles an `AttributeError`, which would occur if the response does not have the expected structure, and returns `None` in such cases.

5. **Relationship with Callees**:
   - This function relies on the `simple_send_with_retries` method to simulate message sending.
   - It uses mocks (`mock_print` and `mock_completion`) to control the behavior of print statements and API responses, ensuring that the test environment is isolated from external dependencies.

6. **Security and Best Practices**:
   - The function demonstrates how the retry mechanism handles rate limit errors without exhausting system resources by limiting retries.
   - It ensures that sensitive information remains secure during testing by using mocks instead of real API calls.

**Note**: Ensure that the `litellm.RateLimitError` is properly defined in your project to avoid runtime issues. Also, verify that the `RETRY_TIMEOUT` constant is correctly set to prevent infinite loops or excessive delays.

### FunctionDef test_send_completion_basic(self, mock_completion)
**test_send_completion_basic**: The function of test_send_completion_basic is to verify the basic functionality of sending completion requests using the specified model and messages.
**parameters**:
· mock_completion: A mock object used to simulate the behavior of the actual completion request.

**Code Description**: This test function sets up a mock response for the `mock_completion` object, simulates calling the `send_completion` function with basic parameters, and asserts that the returned response matches the mock response. The test also verifies that the `mock_completion` method was called exactly once during the process.
1. **Initialization of Mock Response**: A mock response is created using `MagicMock()`, which allows for controlled testing without making real API calls.
2. **Setting Up Mock Behavior**: The `mock_completion.return_value` is set to the mock response, effectively simulating a successful completion request.
3. **Calling send_completion Function**: The `send_completion` function is called with basic parameters: `self.mock_model`, `self.mock_messages`, and `functions=None`, `stream=False`. This mimics sending a non-streamed completion request without additional functions or extra parameters.
4. **Assertions**: 
   - It asserts that the returned response from `send_completion` matches the mock response, ensuring the function returns the expected result.
   - It checks that `mock_completion` was called exactly once to ensure the function behaves as intended.

**Note**: Ensure that `self.mock_model` and `self.mock_messages` are properly initialized before running this test. Also, verify that any necessary mocking or setup for these objects is correctly configured.

**Output Example**: The test will pass if the response from `send_completion` matches the mock response, and `mock_completion` was called exactly once. For example:
```
assert response == <Mock name='mock.return_value' id='...'>
mock_completion.assert_called_once()
```

### FunctionDef test_send_completion_with_functions(self, mock_completion)
**test_send_completion_with_functions**: The function of test_send_completion_with_functions is to verify that functions are properly included when sending completion requests.

**parameters**:
· mock_completion: A mock object used to simulate the behavior of completing a request.
· mock_function: A dictionary representing a mock function with its name and parameters, used as an argument for the send_completion function.

**Code Description**: The test_send_completion_with_functions method is designed to ensure that functions are correctly included when sending completion requests. Here’s a detailed analysis:

The method begins by defining a mock function dictionary `mock_function` with a specified name and parameter type. This setup mimics the input expected by the send_completion function.

Next, it calls the send_completion function with the following parameters:
- `self.mock_model`: A model instance used for testing.
- `self.mock_messages`: A list of messages to be sent to the model.
- `functions=[mock_function]`: The mock function is added as an argument to include in the request.
- `stream=False`: Indicates that the response should not be streamed.

After initiating the completion request, the method checks the arguments passed to the mock_completion object. It asserts that:
1. The 'tools' key exists in the call arguments (`called_kwargs`).
2. The function associated with the tools is equal to the mock_function defined earlier.

This test ensures that when a function is included in the request, it correctly gets integrated into the tools parameter of the completion request, verifying the functionality of the send_completion method.

**Note**: This test assumes that `self.mock_model` and `self.mock_messages` are properly initialized and configured for testing purposes. Ensure these preconditions are met before running this test to avoid any failures due to missing setup.
***
### FunctionDef test_simple_send_attribute_error(self, mock_completion)
**test_simple_send_attribute_error**: The function of `test_simple_send_attribute_error` is to verify that the `simple_send_with_retries` function returns `None` when an `AttributeError` occurs.
**parameters**:
· mock_completion: A mock object used to simulate the behavior of the completion endpoint.

**Code Description**: 
The `test_simple_send_attribute_error` method tests the robustness and error handling mechanism of the `simple_send_with_retries` function. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Setup Mock Object**: The `mock_completion` object is configured to raise an `AttributeError`. This setup simulates a scenario where the completion endpoint does not return expected attributes, such as `choices`.

2. **Invoke Function with Mocked Completion**: The `simple_send_with_retries` function is called with the mocked model and messages. The function is designed to handle various exceptions, including `AttributeError`, by returning `None`.

3. **Assertion Check**: After invoking the function, the result is asserted to be `None`. This ensures that when an unexpected attribute error occurs during the API call, the function correctly handles it by returning `None` without crashing.

4. **Mock Object Configuration**: The mock object's return value and its `choices` attribute are set to `None`, simulating a scenario where the completion endpoint does not provide expected data structures.

**Note**: This test ensures that the system can gracefully handle unexpected errors in API responses, preventing potential crashes or undefined behavior.

**Output Example**: 
The function will return `None`. The exact output is:
```
None
```
***
### FunctionDef test_simple_send_non_retryable_error(self, mock_print, mock_completion)
**test_simple_send_non_retryable_error**: The function of test_simple_send_non_retryable_error is to verify that the `simple_send_with_retries` function handles non-retryable errors correctly by not attempting retries and returning None.

**Parameters**:
· mock_print: A MagicMock object used to simulate print calls.
· mock_completion: A MagicMock object used to simulate completion responses from a language model API.

**Code Description**: 
The test function `test_simple_send_non_retryable_error` is designed to validate the behavior of the `simple_send_with_retries` function when it encounters an error that should not trigger retries. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Setup Mocks and Side Effects**: The function starts by setting up two mocks:
   - `mock_print`: This MagicMock object simulates print calls, which are used to capture any messages printed during the test.
   - `mock_completion`: This MagicMock object is configured to simulate an error response from a language model API. Specifically, it sets the status code to 400 (indicating an HTTP client error) and raises a `litellm.NotFoundError` with a custom message.

2. **Simulate Error Handling**: The function then simulates how `simple_send_with_retries` would handle this error scenario:
   - It attempts to send a completion request using the provided model name, messages, and extra parameters.
   - Since the response is set up as an error (400 status code), the function catches the corresponding exception (`litellm.NotFoundError`).
   - The test checks that `simple_send_with_retries` correctly prints the error message and does not attempt to retry.

3. **Assertion**: By setting up the mocks in a controlled manner, the function ensures that it can accurately verify whether `simple_send_with_retries` behaves as expected when encountering non-retryable errors.

**Note**: This test is crucial for ensuring that the system handles errors gracefully without unnecessary retries, which could lead to performance issues or resource exhaustion. The use of mocks allows precise control over the test environment, making it easier to isolate and verify specific behaviors of the `simple_send_with_retries` function.

# Documentation for `DataProcessor` Class

## Overview

The `DataProcessor` class is designed to handle data preprocessing tasks such as cleaning, normalization, and transformation of raw data into a format suitable for analysis or machine learning models.

## Inheritance

```plaintext
class DataProcessor:
    # Inherits from BaseProcessor
```

## Constructor

### Syntax

```python
def __init__(self, input_data: List[List[Union[int, float]]], target_columns: Optional[List[str]] = None)
```

### Parameters

- `input_data` (List[List[Union[int, float]]]): A 2D list containing the raw data to be processed. Each inner list represents a row of data.
- `target_columns` (Optional[List[str]], optional): A list of column names that need special processing or consideration during data transformation. If not provided, all columns are treated equally.

### Description

The constructor initializes the `DataProcessor` with the raw input data and optionally specified target columns for special handling.

## Methods

### `clean_data`

#### Syntax

```python
def clean_data(self) -> List[List[Union[int, float]]]:
```

#### Returns

- `List[List[Union[int, float]]]`: A 2D list containing the cleaned data. Each inner list represents a row of processed data.

#### Description

This method performs basic cleaning operations on the input data such as removing missing values and ensuring consistent data types.

### `normalize_data`

#### Syntax

```python
def normalize_data(self) -> List[List[float]]:
```

#### Returns

- `List[List[float]]`: A 2D list containing the normalized data. Each inner list represents a row of normalized data.

#### Description

This method normalizes the data to ensure that all features have similar scales, which is crucial for many machine learning algorithms. It uses Min-Max normalization by default but can be configured with other methods if needed.

### `transform_data`

#### Syntax

```python
def transform_data(self) -> List[List[Union[int, float]]]:
```

#### Returns

- `List[List[Union[int, float]]]`: A 2D list containing the transformed data. Each inner list represents a row of transformed data.

#### Description

This method applies specific transformations to the data based on the target columns provided during initialization. Transformations can include encoding categorical variables, scaling features, or applying domain-specific transformations.

### `get_processed_data`

#### Syntax

```python
def get_processed_data(self) -> List[List[Union[int, float]]]:
```

#### Returns

- `List[List[Union[int, float]]]`: A 2D list containing the final processed data. Each inner list represents a row of processed data.

#### Description

This method returns the final processed data after all transformations and cleanings have been applied.

## Example Usage

```python
from typing import List, Union, Optional

class DataProcessor:
    def __init__(self, input_data: List[List[Union[int, float]]], target_columns: Optional[List[str]] = None):
        self.input_data = input_data
        self.target_columns = target_columns
    
    def clean_data(self) -> List[List[Union[int, float]]]:
        # Implementation of cleaning logic
        pass
    
    def normalize_data(self) -> List[List[float]]:
        # Implementation of normalization logic
        pass
    
    def transform_data(self) -> List[List[Union[int, float]]]:
        # Implementation of transformation logic
        pass
    
    def get_processed_data(self) -> List[List[Union[int, float]]]:
        # Final processed data
        return self.transform_data()

# Example usage
input_data = [
    [10.5, 20.3, "A"],
    [None, 15.7, "B"],
    [8.9, 22.4, "C"]
]

processor = DataProcessor(input_data)
cleaned_data = processor.clean_data()
normalized_data = processor.normalize_data()
transformed_data = processor.transform_data()
final_data = processor.get_processed_data()

print(final_data)
```

## Notes

- The `DataProcessor` class is designed to be extendable, allowing for the addition of new cleaning and transformation methods as needed.
- Ensure that the input data is well-formatted and consistent before processing.

#### FunctionDef slow_get_ranked_tags
**slow_get_ranked_tags**: The function of slow_get_ranked_tags is to delay execution by 1.1 seconds before calling another function to get ranked tags.
**parameters**: This Function takes no explicit parameters as it uses `*args` and `**kwargs` to accept any number of positional and keyword arguments, respectively.
**Code Description**: 
The function `slow_get_ranked_tags` is designed to introduce a delay in the execution flow by sleeping for 1.1 seconds using `time.sleep(1.1)`. After the sleep period, it calls another function named `original_get_ranked_tags`, passing through any arguments and keyword arguments received by `slow_get_ranked_tags`. This approach ensures that operations requiring more time are initiated only after a minimum delay, which can be useful in scenarios where immediate responses might not be necessary but maintaining a certain threshold of execution time is important.

The use of `time.sleep(1.1)` specifically guarantees that the function will sleep for at least 1.1 seconds before proceeding to call `original_get_ranked_tags`, ensuring compliance with any predefined timing requirements or avoiding race conditions in concurrent operations.
**Note**: Ensure that the delay introduced by this function does not impact real-time performance-critical tasks. The use of a fixed delay might not be suitable in all scenarios, especially when response times need to be minimized.

**Output Example**: 
The output of `slow_get_ranked_tags` will always be the result returned by `original_get_ranked_tags`, with an additional 1.1-second delay before that result is obtained. For instance, if `original_get_ranked_tags` returns a list of tags such as `['tag1', 'tag2', 'tag3']`, then `slow_get_ranked_tags` will also return the same list after the specified delay.

## ClassDef TestRepoMapTypescript
**TestRepoMapTypescript**: The function of TestRepoMapTypescript is to test the functionality of the `get_repo_map` method in the `RepoMap` class with TypeScript and TSX files.
**attributes**: 
· GPT35: A Model instance representing a specific version of an AI model, used for testing purposes.

**Code Description**: The `TestRepoMapTypescript` class is designed to verify that the `get_repo_map` method correctly identifies and maps TypeScript (`.ts`) and TSX (`.tsx`) files and their associated identifiers. It does this through two test methods: `test_get_repo_map_typescript` and `test_get_repo_map_tsx`.

In the `setUp` method, a temporary directory is created using an `IgnorantTemporaryDirectory` context manager to store sample TypeScript and TSX files. These files contain various TypeScript constructs such as interfaces, types, enums, classes, and functions.

1. **test_get_repo_map_typescript**:
   - A sample `.ts` file named "test_file.ts" is created with content that includes an interface (`IMyInterface`), a type alias (`ExampleType`), an enum (`Status`), a class (`MyClass`), and a function (`myFunction`). 
   - The `get_repo_map` method of the `RepoMap` instance, which uses the GPT35 model, is called with this file as input.
   - Assertions are made to ensure that the result dictionary contains keys for each identifier found in the TypeScript file: "test_file.ts", "IMyInterface", "ExampleType", "Status", "MyClass", "add", and "myFunction".
   
2. **test_get_repo_map_tsx**:
   - A sample `.tsx` file named "test_file.tsx" is created with content that includes an interface (`GreetingProps`), a React functional component (`Greeting`).
   - The `get_repo_map` method of the `RepoMap` instance, which uses the GPT35 model, is called with this file as input.
   - Assertions are made to ensure that the result dictionary contains keys for each identifier found in the TSX file: "test_file.tsx", "GreetingProps", and "Greeting".

Both methods clean up by deleting the `RepoMap` instance after use to avoid leaving open files, which can cause issues on Windows systems.

**Note**: Ensure that the necessary temporary directory context manager (`IgnorantTemporaryDirectory`) and input/output handling classes are properly imported before running these tests. Additionally, verify that the `RepoMap`, `Model`, and other required classes and methods from the relevant modules are correctly implemented to avoid runtime errors.

**Output Example**: The expected output for both test methods is a dictionary where keys represent file names and identifiers found within those files, as verified by the assertions in each method. For example:

```python
{
    'test_file.ts': {
        'IMyInterface': {},
        'ExampleType': {},
        'Status': {},
        'MyClass': {},
        'add': {},
        'myFunction': {}
    }
}
```

and

```python
{
    'test_file.tsx': {
        'GreetingProps': {},
        'Greeting': {}
    }
}
```

The service can be configured via a properties file or environment variables to customize settings such as:

- **Password Complexity**: Minimum requirements for passwords (e.g., length, character types).
- **Session Timeout**: Duration after which an inactive session expires.
- **Logging Level**: Controls the verbosity of audit logs.

Example configuration snippet:
```properties
password.complexity.minimum.length=8
session.timeout.minutes=30
log.level=audit
```

#### Error Handling

The `UserManagementService` handles various exceptions and errors gracefully. Common error conditions include:

- `InvalidCredentialsException`: Thrown when user credentials are incorrect.
- `UserNotFoundException`: Raised when a specified user does not exist.
- `PermissionDeniedException`: Indicates that the user lacks necessary permissions.

Example exception handling:
```java
try {
    userService.loginUser("invaliduser@example.com", "wrongpassword");
} catch (InvalidCredentialsException e) {
    System.err.println("Invalid credentials provided.");
}
```

#### Best Practices

1. **Secure Password Storage**: Use hashing algorithms to securely store user passwords.
2. **Role-Based Access Control**: Define clear roles and permissions to ensure proper access management.
3. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review logs for suspicious activities.

By adhering to these guidelines, the `UserManagementService` ensures a robust and secure environment for managing users within our application framework.

# Documentation for `UserAuthenticationService`

## Overview

The `UserAuthenticationService` is a critical component of our application responsible for handling user authentication and authorization processes. It ensures that users can securely log in, manage their sessions, and access protected resources based on their roles and permissions.

## Key Features

- **User Login**: Facilitates secure login mechanisms using various authentication methods.
- **Session Management**: Manages user sessions to maintain state across multiple requests.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Ensures that users have the appropriate level of access to system resources based on their roles.
- **Token Generation and Validation**: Generates and validates tokens for secure communication between clients and servers.

## Usage

### Initialization

To initialize the `UserAuthenticationService`, you need to configure it with necessary parameters such as database connection details, encryption keys, and session settings.

```csharp
var authenticationService = new UserAuthenticationService(
    connectionString: "your_connection_string",
    encryptionKey: "your_encryption_key",
    secretKeyForTokens: "your_secret_key_for_tokens"
);
```

### User Login

The `Login` method allows users to authenticate themselves by providing their credentials.

```csharp
var loginResult = await authenticationService.Login(
    username: "john_doe",
    password: "password123"
);

if (loginResult.Success)
{
    // Authentication successful, proceed with session management or further actions.
}
else
{
    // Handle failed authentication attempt.
}
```

### Session Management

To manage user sessions, you can use the `StartSession` and `EndSession` methods.

```csharp
// Start a new session for an authenticated user
var sessionId = await authenticationService.StartSession(loginResult.Token);

// End an existing session
await authenticationService.EndSession(sessionId);
```

### Role-Based Access Control

To check if a user has the necessary permissions to access certain resources, use the `HasRole` method.

```csharp
bool isAuthorized = await authenticationService.HasRole(
    sessionId: "user_session_id",
    role: "admin"
);

if (isAuthorized)
{
    // User has admin role and can proceed.
}
else
{
    // User does not have admin role, deny access.
}
```

### Token Generation and Validation

To generate a token for user authentication or validation purposes:

```csharp
string token = await authenticationService.GenerateToken(
    username: "john_doe",
    expirationTime: TimeSpan.FromHours(1)
);

// Validate an existing token
bool isValid = await authenticationService.ValidateToken(token);
```

## Configuration Parameters

- **connectionString**: Database connection string used for storing user credentials and session information.
- **encryptionKey**: Key used to encrypt sensitive data, such as tokens.
- **secretKeyForTokens**: Secret key used in token generation algorithms.

## Best Practices

- Ensure that all encryption keys and secrets are securely stored and managed.
- Regularly review and update authentication mechanisms to mitigate security risks.
- Implement logging and monitoring for suspicious activities or failed login attempts.

## Troubleshooting

- **Validation Failed**: Check the token expiration time and ensure it has not expired.
- **Session Expired**: Ensure that sessions are properly managed and renewed as needed.
- **Permission Denial**: Verify that the user's role matches the required permissions for accessing specific resources.

### FunctionDef tearDown(self)
**tearDown**: The function of tearDown is to revert changes made during testing and clean up temporary resources.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `tearDown` method reverts the state of the environment back to its original condition after running tests. Specifically, it performs two main actions:
- **os.chdir(self.original_cwd)**: Changes the current working directory back to the original directory (`self.original_cwd`) that was set up before the test execution began. This is crucial for ensuring that subsequent operations do not occur in an unintended directory.
- **shutil.rmtree(self.tempdir, ignore_errors=True)**: Deletes the temporary directory (`self.tempdir`) created during testing. The `ignore_errors=True` parameter ensures that any errors encountered during deletion (such as the directory already being deleted) are ignored, preventing test failures due to cleanup issues.

This method is essential for maintaining a clean and predictable environment between test runs, ensuring that tests do not interfere with each other or leave behind unnecessary files and directories. By restoring the original state, it helps in verifying that subsequent tests start from a known good configuration.
**Note**: Always ensure that `self.original_cwd` and `self.tempdir` are properly set up before calling `tearDown`. Failure to do so may result in unexpected behavior during test execution or cleanup.

#### Methods

1. **authenticate(username: String, password: String): Boolean**
   - **Description**: Validates the provided username and password against stored credentials.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `username`: The user's username as a string.
     - `password`: The user's plain-text password as a string.
   - **Return Value**: Returns `true` if the authentication is successful, otherwise returns `false`.

2. **generateToken(user: User): String**
   - **Description**: Generates and returns a JWT token for the authenticated user.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `user`: An instance of the `User` class containing relevant user information.
   - **Return Value**: Returns a string representing the generated JWT token.

3. **validateToken(token: String): Boolean**
   - **Description**: Validates whether the provided token is valid and has not expired.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `token`: The JWT token to validate as a string.
   - **Return Value**: Returns `true` if the token is valid, otherwise returns `false`.

#### Usage Example

# Assuming UserAuthentication and User classes are properly defined
auth = UserAuthentication()

# Authenticate a user
isAuthenticated = auth.authenticate("john_doe", "secure_password123")
if isAuthenticated:
    print("Authentication successful.")
else:
    print("Authentication failed.")

# Generate a token for the authenticated user
user = User(id=1, username="john_doe", role="admin")
token = auth.generateToken(user)
print(f"Generated Token: {token}")

# Validate the generated token
isValid = auth.validateToken(token)
if isValid:
    print("Token is valid.")
else:
    print("Token is invalid or has expired.")

#### FunctionDef capture_output
**capture_output**: The function of `capture_output` is to store command output lines in a list and call another function to handle the original tool output.

**parameters**: 
· parameter1: *args - A variable-length argument list that captures all positional arguments passed to the function.
· parameter2: **kwargs - A variable-length keyword argument dictionary that captures all keyword arguments passed to the function.

**Code Description**: The `capture_output` function serves as a middleware between command execution and tool output handling. It takes in any number of positional and keyword arguments, appends them to an existing list called `output_lines`, and then calls another function named `original_tool_output`. This design allows for capturing multiple lines of output from commands while also ensuring that the original tool's output is processed as intended.

1. The function begins by appending all positional arguments (`*args`) passed to it into a predefined list `output_lines`. This list likely contains and stores command outputs, making it possible to track or analyze the output later.
2. After storing the output lines, the function proceeds to call another function named `original_tool_output` with the same arguments that were passed to `capture_output`. The use of `*args` and `**kwargs` ensures that all original parameters are preserved during this call.

This approach is useful in scenarios where you need to capture command outputs for logging or analysis purposes while still allowing the tool to handle its primary output functionality. By separating these concerns, developers can create more flexible and modular code structures.

**Note**: Ensure that `output_lines` is properly initialized before calling `capture_output`. Additionally, verify that `original_tool_output` is defined elsewhere in your codebase and that it handles the arguments appropriately.

## Detailed Description

### Constructor (`__init__`)

The `DatabaseManager` class constructor accepts parameters necessary for establishing a database connection. These include the hostname or IP address of the server (`host`), the port number where the database is listening (`port`), the username and password used for authentication, and the name of the database to connect to (`dbname`).

### Method: `connect`

This method initializes a connection to the specified database using the provided credentials. It ensures that the application can communicate with the database.

### Method: `disconnect`

This method closes the current database connection, freeing up resources and preventing potential leaks.

### Method: `execute_query`

The `execute_query` method allows for executing arbitrary SQL queries against the connected database. This method takes a query string as input along with optional parameters to be passed to the query. It returns a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a row returned by the query, making it easy to process and manipulate the results.

### Method: `execute_transaction`

This method is used for executing multiple SQL statements as part of a transaction. The provided list of queries will be executed in sequence within a single transaction. If all queries execute successfully, the changes are committed; otherwise, they are rolled back to maintain data integrity.

### Method: `get_connection_status`

The `get_connection_status` method returns the current connection status, indicating whether the database is currently accessible or not. This can be useful for debugging and ensuring that operations only proceed when a valid connection exists.

## Usage Example

```python
# Initialize DatabaseManager with necessary credentials
db_manager = DatabaseManager('localhost', 5432, 'user', 'password', 'mydatabase')

# Connect to the database
db_manager.connect()

# Execute a simple query
results = db_manager.execute_query("SELECT * FROM users")

# Perform a transaction with multiple queries
queries = [
    "UPDATE users SET balance = balance + 10 WHERE id = 1",
    "INSERT INTO transactions (user_id, amount) VALUES (1, 10)"
]
db_manager.execute_transaction(queries)

# Disconnect from the database
db_manager.disconnect()
```

## Notes

- Ensure that sensitive information such as usernames and passwords are handled securely.
- The `execute_query` method supports parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. Always use parameters when executing dynamic queries.

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide for understanding and utilizing the `DatabaseManager` class effectively within your application.

# Documentation for `DatabaseManager`

## Overview

`DatabaseManager` is a critical component of our application designed to handle all database interactions efficiently and securely. It abstracts away complex database operations, ensuring that developers can focus on their core logic without worrying about low-level details.

## Key Features

- **Connection Management**: Establishes and maintains connections to the database.
- **Query Execution**: Executes SQL queries for data retrieval, insertion, update, and deletion.
- **Transaction Handling**: Supports transaction management to ensure data integrity.
- **Error Handling**: Provides robust error handling mechanisms to manage exceptions gracefully.

## Usage

### Initialization

To initialize `DatabaseManager`, you need to provide the necessary connection details such as host, port, username, password, and database name. Here’s an example of how to set it up:

```python
from db_manager import DatabaseManager

# Initialize the DatabaseManager with required parameters
db_manager = DatabaseManager(
    host="localhost",
    port=5432,
    user="admin",
    password="password123",
    database_name="mydatabase"
)
```

### Query Execution

`DatabaseManager` supports executing various types of SQL queries. Here are some common methods:

#### Execute a Simple SELECT Query

```python
result = db_manager.execute_query("SELECT * FROM users")
for row in result:
    print(row)
```

#### Insert Data into the Database

```python
insert_query = "INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (%s, %s)"
data = ("John Doe", "john.doe@example.com")
db_manager.execute_query(insert_query, data)
```

#### Execute a DELETE Query

```python
delete_query = "DELETE FROM users WHERE id = %s"
user_id = 42
db_manager.execute_query(delete_query, (user_id,))
```

### Transaction Management

Transactions can be managed using the `start_transaction` and `commit` methods. This ensures that all operations within a transaction are completed successfully or rolled back if any part fails.

```python
# Start a new transaction
with db_manager.start_transaction():
    try:
        # Execute multiple queries as part of the same transaction
        db_manager.execute_query("UPDATE users SET active = True WHERE id = 1")
        db_manager.execute_query("INSERT INTO logs (user_id, action) VALUES (%s, %s)", (1, "User activated"))
        
        # Commit the transaction if all operations are successful
        db_manager.commit()
    except Exception as e:
        # Rollback the transaction on failure
        db_manager.rollback()
```

### Error Handling

`DatabaseManager` includes comprehensive error handling to manage database-related exceptions. It provides clear and informative error messages, making it easier to diagnose issues.

```python
try:
    result = db_manager.execute_query("SELECT * FROM non_existent_table")
except DatabaseError as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

## Best Practices

- **Use Parameterized Queries**: Always use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- **Close Connections Properly**: Ensure that database connections are closed properly after usage.
- **Handle Exceptions Gracefully**: Implement proper error handling strategies to ensure the application remains stable and user-friendly.

## Conclusion

`DatabaseManager` is a powerful tool for managing database interactions in our application. By abstracting away complex operations, it allows developers to focus on building robust and scalable applications while ensuring data integrity and security.

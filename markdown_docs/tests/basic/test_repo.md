  - `/reset-password`: POST request to initiate password reset process.

#### Implementation

The `UserAuthenticationService` class is structured as follows:

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.UserDetails;
import org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.UserDetailsService;
import org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.UsernameNotFoundException;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class UserAuthenticationService implements UserDetailsService {

    @Autowired
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    // Method to register a new user
    public void registerUser(User user) {
        userRepository.save(user);
    }

    // Method to authenticate a user and return UserDetails object
    @Override
    public UserDetails loadUserByUsername(String usernameOrEmail) throws UsernameNotFoundException {
        User user = userRepository.findByUsernameOrEmail(usernameOrEmail, usernameOrEmail)
                .orElseThrow(() -> new UsernameNotFoundException("User not found with username or email: " + usernameOrEmail));

        return new org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.User(user.getUsername(), user.getPassword(), getAuthority());
    }

    // Method to generate authority (role) for the user
    private Collection<? extends GrantedAuthority> getAuthority() {
        return AuthorityUtils.createAuthorityList("USER");
    }
}
```

#### Usage

1. **Registering a New User**:
   ```java
   UserRegistrationRequest registrationRequest = new UserRegistrationRequest();
   registrationRequest.setUsername("john_doe");
   registrationRequest.setPassword("password123");
   registrationRequest.setEmail("john@example.com");

   userAuthenticationService.registerUser(registrationRequest.toEntity());
   ```

2. **Logging In**:
   ```java
   Authentication authentication = authenticationManager.authenticate(
           new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(usernameOrEmail, password));

   SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(authentication);
   ```

3. **Resetting Password**:
   ```java
   String resetLink = userAuthenticationService.sendPasswordResetEmail(email);
   // Send the resetLink to the user's email for them to reset their password.
   ```

#### Best Practices

- Ensure that passwords are hashed and stored securely.

### FunctionDef test_noop_commit(self, mock_send)
### Object: UserAuthenticationService

#### Overview

The `UserAuthenticationService` is a critical component of the application responsible for managing user authentication processes. It ensures secure and reliable access to system resources by validating user credentials and providing session management functionalities.

#### Responsibilities

1. **Credential Validation**: Validates user login credentials (username, password) against the database.
2. **Session Management**: Manages active user sessions, including session creation, renewal, and termination.
3. **Token Generation**: Generates JWT tokens for secure authentication and authorization.
4. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Enforces role-based access control policies to restrict or grant access to system resources.

#### Methods

1. **Login**
   - **Description**: Authenticates a user based on provided credentials.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `username`: The username of the user attempting to log in (string).
     - `password`: The password of the user attempting to log in (string).
   - **Return Value**: 
     - `UserAuthenticationResponse`: A response object containing session details and a JWT token upon successful authentication.
     - `null`: If authentication fails.

2. **Logout**
   - **Description**: Terminates the current user's session.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `token`: The JWT token of the user attempting to log out (string).
   - **Return Value**:
     - `boolean`: `true` if the logout was successful, `false` otherwise.

3. **GenerateToken**
   - **Description**: Generates a new JWT token for an authenticated user.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `userId`: The unique identifier of the user (string or integer).
   - **Return Value**:
     - `string`: A JWT token representing the user's authentication state.

4. **CheckAuthorization**
   - **Description**: Verifies if a user has the necessary permissions to access a specific resource.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `token`: The JWT token of the user (string).
     - `resourceId`: The unique identifier of the resource being accessed (string or integer).
     - `requiredRole`: The role required to access the resource (string).
   - **Return Value**:
     - `boolean`: `true` if the user has the required role, `false` otherwise.

#### Example Usage

```python
# Example Login Call
response = UserAuthenticationService.Login("john_doe", "password123")
if response:
    print(f"Logged in successfully. Token: {response.jwtToken}")
else:
    print("Login failed.")

# Example Logout Call
logout_success = UserAuthenticationService.Logout("eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9")
print(f"Logout result: {logout_success}")

# Example Token Generation
token = UserAuthenticationService.GenerateToken(12345)
print(f"Generated token: {token}")

# Example Authorization Check
is_authorized = UserAuthenticationService.CheckAuthorization("eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9", "resource-001", "admin")
print(f"Authorized to access resource? {is_authorized}")
```

#### Notes

- The `UserAuthenticationService` relies on a secure and reliable database for storing user credentials.
- It uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for session management, providing a stateless and scalable solution.
- Role-based access control policies are enforced using predefined roles stored in the application's configuration.

This documentation serves as a reference guide for developers working with the `UserAuthenticationService` to ensure consistent and secure implementation.

## ClassDef TestScrape
**TestScrape**: The function of TestScrape is to test various functionalities related to web scraping using different methods and scenarios.
**Code Description**: 
The `TestScrape` class within the `test_scrape.py` file contains several test methods that validate the behavior of a `Scraper` object under different conditions, including SSL verification, playwright availability, error handling, and content processing. Each method simulates specific use cases to ensure the robustness and reliability of the scraping process.

- **test_scrape_self_signed_ssl**: This method tests how the scraper handles self-signed SSL certificates by verifying that it returns `None` when SSL verification is enabled (`verify_ssl=True`) and ensuring that the print error function is called. Conversely, it checks that the scraper can successfully scrape a URL without SSL verification (`verify_ssl=False`) and that the expected content is present in the result.

- **setUp**: This method sets up common test fixtures for other test methods. It initializes an `InputOutput` object with `yes=True` to simulate user input and a `Commands` object, which manages commands related to web operations.

- **test_cmd_web_imports_playwright**: This method tests whether the `cmd_web` command can successfully import the `playwright` module after executing it. It ensures that no error is thrown during the import process by mocking the print error function and checking if the `playwright` module has been imported without any issues.

- **test_scrape_actual_url_with_playwright**: This method tests scraping a real URL using Playwright, asserting that the expected content ("Example Domain") is present in the result. It also ensures that the print error function is not called during this process.

- **test_scrape_text_plain**: This method verifies that the scraper correctly processes plain text content returned by the `scrape_with_playwright` method and returns it as-is.

- **test_scrape_text_html**: This method tests the conversion of HTML content to markdown using the `html_to_markdown` method. It ensures that the expected markdown is generated from the provided HTML content.

**Note**: 
1. Ensure that all dependencies, such as `InputOutput`, `Commands`, and `Scraper`, are properly set up before running these tests.
2. The test methods assume that certain mock functions (`scrape_with_playwright` and `html_to_markdown`) behave as expected to validate the scraper's behavior accurately.

**Output Example**: 
- For `test_scrape_self_signed_ssl` with `verify_ssl=True`, the output might be:
  ```
  None
  True
  ```

- For `test_cmd_web_imports_playwright`, if successful, no error messages are printed, and the `playwright` module is imported without issues.

- For `test_scrape_text_html`, the expected markdown content could be:
  ```
  # Test
  This is HTML content.
  ```

await userService.revokeToken(jwtToken);
```

#### Notes
- The `User` object should contain at least the following properties: `id`, `username`, and `role`.
- Ensure that all tokens are securely stored and transmitted to prevent unauthorized access.

This documentation provides a clear understanding of the `UserAuthenticationService` and its methods, ensuring that developers can effectively use it in their application.
#### FunctionDef scrape_with_retries(scraper, url, max_retries, delay)
**scrape_with_retries**: The function of `scrape_with_retries` is to attempt to scrape a URL multiple times until successful or the maximum number of retries is reached.
**Parameters**: 
· scraper: An instance of the `Scraper` class used for scraping operations.
· url: A string representing the URL to be scraped.
· max_retries: An integer specifying the maximum number of retry attempts (default is 5).
· delay: A float indicating the time in seconds to wait between retries (default is 0.5).

**Code Description**: The `scrape_with_retries` function is designed to handle scenarios where scraping a URL might fail due to transient issues such as network problems or server errors. It provides a mechanism to retry the scraping operation up to a specified number of times with a delay between each attempt.

The function works by initializing a loop that runs from 0 to `max_retries - 1`. In each iteration, it calls the `scrape` method of the provided `scraper` instance with the given URL. If the result is not `None`, indicating successful scraping, the function returns the result immediately.

If all attempts fail and no result is returned by any of the `max_retries`, the function returns `None`. This approach ensures that transient issues do not prevent the entire operation from succeeding, while still respecting a reasonable number of retries to handle temporary failures effectively.

The use of `time.sleep(delay)` between each retry introduces a delay to avoid overwhelming the server with too many requests in quick succession. This is particularly useful when dealing with rate-limited or unstable servers.

**Note**: It's important to ensure that the `scraper` instance passed to this function has appropriate methods (`scrape`) and error handling mechanisms to handle different types of responses from the URL being scraped. Additionally, the delay between retries should be adjusted based on the specific requirements and characteristics of the target server or resource.

**Output Example**: 
If the scraping operation is successful on the first attempt:
```
result = scrape_with_retries(scraper_instance, "https://example.com", max_retries=5, delay=0.5)
print(result)  # Output: Scraped content as markdown
```

If all attempts fail and no result is returned:
```
result = scrape_with_retries(scraper_instance, "https://example.com", max_retries=5, delay=0.5)
print(result)  # Output: None
```

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the `CustomerProfile` object, including its structure, methods, and usage examples.
#### FunctionDef mock_content
**mock_content**: The function of mock_content is to simulate an error scenario when using Playwright.
**parameters**: This Function has no parameters.

**Code Description**: The `mock_content` function is designed to raise a specific error from the Playwright library, which helps in testing and debugging scenarios where errors might occur during web scraping or automation tasks. By intentionally raising a `playwright._impl._errors.Error`, this function can be used as part of test cases to ensure that your application handles such errors gracefully.

The function does not take any parameters, making it simple and flexible for use in various testing contexts. When called, the function will always raise an error with the message "Test error". This error handling mechanism is particularly useful when you want to verify how your code behaves under unexpected conditions or during critical operations like web page interactions.

**Note**: Always ensure that this function is used within a controlled environment for testing purposes only. Directly invoking `mock_content` in production code could disrupt the normal operation of your application and should be avoided. Additionally, when integrating this mock error handling into test cases, consider providing more descriptive error messages to better reflect the specific conditions you are simulating.

### Documentation for `UserAuthenticationService`

#### Overview

The `UserAuthenticationService` is a critical component of our application responsible for managing user authentication processes. This service ensures secure and efficient user login, registration, and logout functionalities.

#### Key Features

- **Secure Authentication**: Implements industry-standard security protocols to protect user credentials.
- **Token-Based Authentication**: Utilizes JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure token generation and validation.
- **User Registration**: Allows new users to create accounts with email and password verification.
- **Password Reset**: Provides a mechanism for users to reset their passwords securely.
- **Session Management**: Manages user sessions, ensuring that each session is unique and secure.

#### Class Structure

```java
public class UserAuthenticationService {
    
    // Private fields for internal state management
    private final UserRepository userRepository;
    private final PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder;

    // Constructor injection to ensure dependencies are properly set up
    public UserAuthenticationService(UserRepository userRepository, PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
        this.passwordEncoder = passwordEncoder;
    }

    /**
     * Registers a new user.
     *
     * @param username The unique identifier for the user.
     * @param email The user's email address.
     * @param password The user's password, which will be encoded before storage.
     * @return A boolean indicating whether the registration was successful.
     */
    public boolean registerUser(String username, String email, String password) {
        // Check if the username or email is already taken
        if (userRepository.existsByUsername(username)) {
            return false;
        }
        if (userRepository.existsByEmail(email)) {
            return false;
        }

        // Encode the password before storing it in the database
        String encodedPassword = passwordEncoder.encode(password);
        User user = new User(username, email, encodedPassword);
        userRepository.save(user);

        return true;
    }

    /**
     * Authenticates a user.
     *
     * @param username The unique identifier for the user.
     * @param password The user's password to be verified against stored credentials.
     * @return A boolean indicating whether authentication was successful.
     */
    public boolean authenticateUser(String username, String password) {
        User user = userRepository.findByUsername(username);
        if (user == null) {
            return false;
        }

        // Verify the provided password against the stored encoded password
        return passwordEncoder.matches(password, user.getPassword());
    }

    /**
     * Generates a JWT token for a given user.
     *
     * @param username The unique identifier for the user.
     * @return A String containing the generated JWT token.
     */
    public String generateToken(String username) {
        // Implementation to generate and return a JWT token
        return "JWT_TOKEN_" + username;
    }

    /**
     * Logs out a user by invalidating their session.
     *
     * @param username The unique identifier for the user.
     */
    public void logoutUser(String username) {
        // Implementation to invalidate the user's session
        System.out.println("Logging out user: " + username);
    }
}
```

#### Dependencies

- **UserRepository**: Interface for interacting with the database to manage users.
- **PasswordEncoder**: Utility class for encoding and verifying passwords.

#### Usage Examples

```java
// Example of registering a new user
UserAuthenticationService authService = new UserAuthenticationService(userRepo, passwordEncoder);
boolean registrationSuccess = authService.registerUser("john_doe", "johndoe@example.com", "securepassword123");

if (registrationSuccess) {
    System.out.println("Registration successful.");
} else {
    System.out.println("Registration failed. Username or email already exists.");
}

// Example of authenticating a user
boolean authenticationSuccess = authService.authenticateUser("john_doe", "securepassword123");
if (authenticationSuccess) {
    System.out.println("Authentication successful.");
} else {
    System.out.println("Authentication failed.");
}

// Example of generating a JWT token
String jwtToken = authService.generateToken("john_doe");
System.out.println("Generated JWT Token: " + jwtToken);

// Example of logging out a user
authService.logoutUser("john_doe");
```

#### Best Practices

- Always use secure password storage techniques, such as hashing and salting.
- Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks during authentication attempts.
- Ensure that all sensitive data is protected both in transit and at rest.

This documentation aims to provide a clear understanding of the `UserAuthenticationService` class, its methods, and best practices for usage.

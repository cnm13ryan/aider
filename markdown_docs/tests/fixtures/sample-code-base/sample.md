## ClassDef Car
**Car**: The function of Car is to represent a vehicle with attributes such as make, model, and year, along with methods to control its speed and interact with it.

**attributes**: 
· make: Represents the manufacturer or brand of the car.
· model: Specifies the particular type or variant of the car.
· year: Indicates the manufacturing year of the car.
· speed: Tracks the current speed of the car in miles per hour (mph), initialized to 0.

**Code Description**: The `Car` class is designed to simulate a basic representation of a vehicle, focusing on its make, model, and year. It also provides methods to manipulate the car's speed and interact with it through user-defined actions.

- **__init__(self, make, model, year)**: This method initializes a new instance of the `Car` class. The parameters are:
  - `make`: A string indicating the manufacturer or brand (e.g., "Toyota").
  - `model`: A string specifying the particular type or variant (e.g., "Corolla").
  - `year`: An integer representing the manufacturing year (e.g., 2020).

- **accelerate(self, increment)**: This method increases the car's speed by a specified amount. The parameter is:
  - `increment`: An integer indicating how much to increase the speed by.
  - It updates the `speed` attribute and prints out the new speed.

- **brake(self, decrement)**: This method decreases the car's speed by a specified amount but ensures that the speed does not go below zero. The parameter is:
  - `decrement`: An integer indicating how much to decrease the speed by.
  - It updates the `speed` attribute and prints out the new speed.

- **honk(self)**: This method simulates the car honking, printing a message that includes the make and model of the car. The output is:
  - "Make Model: Beep beep!"

**Relationship with Callers**: In the `main()` function, two instances of the `Car` class are created (`car1` for Toyota Corolla and `car2` for Tesla Model 3). These cars are then used to demonstrate basic functionalities such as accelerating, honking, and braking. Additionally, an instance of a `Garage` class is created, which adds these cars to a collection and manages their list.

**Note**: Ensure that the car's speed values remain within logical bounds (non-negative) when using the `accelerate` and `brake` methods. Also, be aware that the `honk` method provides a simple text output for demonstration purposes and does not perform any action in an actual vehicle context.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, make, model, year)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the Car class.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: make (The make or brand of the car)
· parameter2: model (The specific model of the car)
· parameter3: year (The manufacturing year of the car)

**Code Description**: 
This method serves as a constructor for the `Car` class, which is called automatically when an instance of the class is created. It initializes several attributes that represent key properties of the car:

- **self.make = make**: This line sets the `make` attribute to the value passed in via the `make` parameter. The `make` attribute stores information about the brand or manufacturer of the car.
  
- **self.model = model**: Similarly, this line assigns the `model` attribute with the value from the `model` parameter. The `model` attribute holds the specific type of vehicle (e.g., sedan, SUV) and its variant.

- **self.year = year**: This sets the `year` attribute to the value provided by the `year` parameter. The `year` attribute stores the manufacturing year of the car, which is useful for determining the age or vintage of a vehicle.

- **self.speed = 0**: Finally, this line initializes the `speed` attribute with an initial value of zero. This attribute will keep track of how fast the car is traveling and can be updated as the car's speed changes throughout its lifecycle.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the parameters passed to the constructor match those defined in the method signature. Additionally, when creating instances of the `Car` class, provide valid values for these parameters to properly initialize a new car object with meaningful attributes.
***
### FunctionDef accelerate(self, increment)
**accelerate**: The function of accelerate is to increase the speed of the car by a specified increment.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: self - This is a reference to the instance of the Car class on which the method is called.
· parameter2: increment - An integer value representing the amount by which the current speed of the car should be increased.

**Code Description**: The accelerate function in the Car class modifies the speed attribute of the car object by adding the specified increment to its current speed. It then prints a message indicating the make, model, and new speed of the car.
The accelerate method is called within the main function, where two instances of the Car class are created: one for a Toyota Corolla from 2020 and another for a Tesla Model 3 from 2022. The accelerate method is used to demonstrate how the speed can be increased by calling it with an increment value (e.g., `car1.accelerate(30)`). This showcases the functionality of the Car class in managing the car's speed attribute, which is updated and displayed through this method.

The relationship between the accelerate function and its caller main is that the main function serves as a demonstration or test case for various methods within the Car class. By calling `car1.accelerate(30)`, it illustrates how an instance of the Car class can be manipulated to change its speed, providing a practical example of the method's functionality.

**Note**: Ensure that the increment value passed to the accelerate function is appropriate and does not exceed the maximum speed limit for the car. Additionally, consider adding validation or error handling in production code to manage unexpected values or edge cases.
***
### FunctionDef brake(self, decrement)
**brake**: The function of brake is to decelerate the car by reducing its speed.
**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: decrement - An integer representing the amount by which the car's current speed should be reduced.

**Code Description**: 
The `brake` method in the `Car` class is responsible for slowing down a car instance. When called, it takes an argument `decrement`, which specifies how much to reduce the car’s current speed. The function first updates the car's speed by subtracting the given decrement from its current speed using the `max(0, self.speed - decrement)` expression to ensure that the speed does not go below zero. After updating the speed, it prints a message indicating the make and model of the car, along with its new speed.

This method is critical for simulating realistic driving behavior in the context of the sample code provided. It allows users or other parts of the program to control how quickly a car slows down when needed, such as during braking scenarios. In the `main` function, this method is called after an acceleration event (using `accelerate`) and before adding cars to a garage (`Garage`), demonstrating its practical use in managing a car's state.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `decrement` value provided is appropriate for the current speed of the car. An excessive decrement can result in a negative or zero speed, which might not be desirable depending on the scenario.
- The method assumes that the `speed`, `make`, and `model` attributes are correctly set and available within the `Car` instance.
***
### FunctionDef honk(self)
**honk**: The function of honk is to simulate the sound a car makes when its horn is pressed.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `honk` method within the `Car` class prints out a string that represents the make and model of the car followed by "Beep beep!" to mimic the sound of a car's horn. When called on an instance of the `Car` class, this function outputs a message indicating which car is honking.

In the context of the project, specifically within the `main` function located in `sample.py`, `honk` is utilized to demonstrate one of the methods available for instances of the `Car` class. For example:
```python
car1 = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020)
car1.honk()
```
This line of code creates a car instance and then calls the `honk` method on it, resulting in the output: 
```
Toyota Corolla: Beep beep!
```

This functionality helps to showcase how methods can be used to interact with objects and provide additional information or actions related to those objects. The `main` function demonstrates this by creating two car instances (`car1` and `car2`) and then calling their respective `honk` methods, thereby illustrating the behavior of these cars in a simple yet effective manner.

**Note**: Ensure that before invoking the `honk` method on any `Car` instance, an instance of the class must be created. Also, note that the `honk` function does not return any value; it only prints the message to the console.
***
## ClassDef Garage
**Garage**: The function of Garage is to manage a collection of cars within a garage setting.
**attributes**: 
· cars: A list that stores all the cars currently present in the garage.

**Code Description**: 

The `Garage` class provides methods for managing a collection of cars. It allows adding, removing, and listing cars stored in the garage. Here is an in-depth analysis:

- **Constructor (`__init__` method)**: 
  - Initializes an empty list to store cars.
  
- **add_car Method**: 
  - Accepts a `car` object as a parameter.
  - Adds the car to the `cars` list and prints a confirmation message indicating that the car has been added.

- **remove_car Method**: 
  - Takes a `car` object as an argument.
  - Checks if the car is present in the `cars` list. If found, it removes the car from the list and prints a confirmation message. If not found, it prints a message indicating that the car is not in the garage.

- **list_cars Method**: 
  - Iterates through the `cars` list to print details of each car present in the garage.
  - If no cars are present, it informs that the garage is empty.

**Note**: The `Garage` class interacts with other classes (like `Car`) but does not provide any methods for interacting directly with those objects. It focuses solely on managing a collection of cars within its context.

In the calling scenario in `main()`, the `Garage` instance (`my_garage`) is used to add two cars (`car1` and `car2`) to the garage, list them, remove one car, and then re-list the remaining cars. This demonstrates how a `Garage` can be utilized to manage multiple cars in different operations such as adding, removing, and listing.

**Note**: Ensure that the `Car` class is properly defined elsewhere in your codebase, as it is used within the methods of the `Garage` class.
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the Garage class.
**parameters**: 
· self: A reference to the current instance of the class.

**Code Description**: The `__init__` method serves as the constructor for the `Garage` class. It is automatically called when a new instance of the `Garage` class is created. This method initializes an empty list named `cars`, which will be used to store information about the cars parked in the garage.

In more detail, this method does not accept any additional parameters beyond `self`. The `self` parameter refers to the current instance of the `Garage` class and allows access to its attributes. Within the method, a list named `cars` is created and initialized as an empty list. This list will be used throughout the lifecycle of the `Garage` instance to keep track of the cars that are parked inside it.

This approach ensures that each `Garage` object starts with a clean slate, ready for new car entries without any pre-existing data from other instances.

**Note**: Ensure that you always call the `__init__` method when creating a new `Garage` instance to properly initialize its state. Failure to do so might result in an uninitialized `cars` list or unexpected behavior within methods that rely on this attribute.
***
### FunctionDef add_car(self, car)
**add_car**: The function of add_car is to add a car instance to the garage's collection.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: car (instance of Car)
**Code Description**: 
The `add_car` method is responsible for adding a new car instance to the garage’s list of cars. It appends the provided `car` object to the `self.cars` list, which maintains all the cars stored in the garage. Additionally, it prints a message indicating that the specified car has been added.

This function plays a crucial role in managing the collection of cars within the garage. When called with an instance of a `Car`, such as `car1 = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020)`, it updates the state of the `Garage` object by adding this car to its internal list and informing the user about the addition.

In the context of the project, `add_car` is utilized in the `main` function. Specifically, after creating instances of cars (`car1` and `car2`) using the `Car` class, these are passed as arguments to `add_car`. For example:
```python
my_garage.add_car(car1)
```
This line adds `car1` to the garage's collection and prints "Added Toyota Corolla to the garage." This demonstrates how `add_car` integrates with other parts of the project, such as creating and managing car instances.

**Note**: Ensure that only valid `Car` instances are passed to `add_car` to avoid errors. The method assumes that the input is a properly instantiated `Car` object; otherwise, it may lead to unexpected behavior or runtime errors.
***
### FunctionDef remove_car(self, car)
**remove_car**: The function of remove_car is to remove a specified car from the garage.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: car (Car) - The car instance that needs to be removed from the garage.

**Code Description**: This function serves as an essential method for managing cars within a Garage object. It checks if the given car instance exists in the list of cars (`self.cars`). If the car is found, it removes the car from the list and prints a confirmation message indicating which car has been removed. Conversely, if the specified car does not exist in the garage, it prints a message stating that the car is not present.

This function is called by the `main` function in tests/fixtures/sample-code-base/sample.py/main to demonstrate its functionality. In the example provided, after adding two cars (`car1` and `car2`) to the garage and listing them, the `remove_car(car1)` method is invoked to remove `car1`. This process showcases how the Garage object can manage a collection of cars dynamically by allowing cars to be added or removed as needed.

**Note**: Ensure that only valid car instances are passed to this function to avoid errors. The `self.cars` list should always contain only Car objects, and any attempt to remove a non-existent car will result in an informational message being printed without altering the garage's state.
***
### FunctionDef list_cars(self)
**list_cars**: The function of list_cars is to display the cars currently stored in the garage.
**parameters**: 
· self: This method is an instance method, meaning it operates on an instance of the Garage class.

**Code Description**: 
The `list_cars` method serves as a utility for displaying information about all the cars stored within a garage. Here’s a detailed analysis:

1. **Condition Check**: The function first checks if there are any cars in the garage by evaluating the length of the `self.cars` list.
2. **Printing Cars**: If the garage contains at least one car, it iterates over each car and prints its details in a formatted string that includes the year, make, and model of the car.
3. **Empty Garage Handling**: If no cars are present in the garage (i.e., `self.cars` is an empty list), it informs the user that the garage is empty.

This method provides a clear and concise way to verify the contents of the garage at any point during the program's execution, which can be particularly useful for debugging or logging purposes. It helps ensure that all added cars are correctly stored and accessible within the system.

**Note**: Ensure that the `self.cars` list is properly populated before calling this method. This function should only be called after adding cars to the garage using methods like `add_car`. Additionally, consider handling cases where `self.cars` might not contain instances of a specific car class, as this could lead to potential errors or unexpected behavior when printing details.

## FunctionDef get_versions_supporting_python38_or_lower(package_name)
**get_versions_supporting_python38_or_lower**: The function of `get_versions_supporting_python38_or_lower` is to fetch and determine which versions of a given package are compatible with Python 3.8 or lower.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: `package_name` - A string representing the name of the package for which you want to find compatible versions.

**Code Description**: The function `get_versions_supporting_python38_or_lower` takes the name of a package and retrieves its version information from PyPI (Python Package Index). It then checks each release's `requires_python` attribute to determine if it supports Python 3.8 or lower. If no `requires_python` is specified, the function assumes compatibility with Python 3.8 based on unspecified criteria.

1. **URL Construction**: The function constructs a URL using the package name and sends an HTTP GET request to PyPI.
2. **Response Handling**: It checks if the response status code is 200 (OK). If not, it prints a failure message and returns an empty dictionary.
3. **Data Parsing**: Upon receiving a successful response, the JSON data from PyPI is parsed into a Python dictionary.
4. **Release Iteration**: The function iterates over each release in the package's version history.
5. **Empty Release Check**: It skips releases that have no associated information.
6. **Requires_Python Check**: For each non-empty release, it checks if `requires_python` is specified.
7. **Version Compatibility Determination**: If `requires_python` is not specified, a default message indicating assumed compatibility with Python 3.8 or lower is added to the dictionary. Otherwise, it attempts to parse `requires_python` using the `SpecifierSet` class from the `packaging` module and checks if "3.8" is within this specification.
8. **Error Handling**: If parsing fails due to an invalid specifier, a message is printed, and the release is skipped.

The function returns a dictionary where keys are version numbers and values are descriptions of compatibility with Python 3.8 or lower.

**Note**: Ensure that you have the `requests` and `packaging` libraries installed in your environment as they are required for this function to work correctly.

**Output Example**: A possible return value could be:
```
{
    "1.2.3": "Compatible with Python 3.8 (spec: >=3.6,<4.0)",
    "1.2.2": "Unspecified (assumed compatible with Python 3.8 and lower)"
}
```
## FunctionDef main
**main**: The function of main is to determine and print versions of a specified package that are compatible with Python 3.8 or lower.
· parameter1: `package_name` - A string representing the name of the package for which you want to find compatible versions.

**Code Description**: 
The `main` function serves as the entry point for determining and printing the versions of a given package that are compatible with Python 3.8 or lower. It first sets the `package_name` variable, which should be replaced with the actual name of the package you want to check (in this example, it is set to "aider-chat"). 

The function then calls `get_versions_supporting_python38_or_lower`, passing in the `package_name`. This function retrieves and processes version information from PyPI for the specified package. It constructs a URL using the package name and sends an HTTP GET request to fetch data. If the response status code is not 200, it prints a failure message and returns an empty dictionary.

Upon receiving a successful response, `get_versions_supporting_python38_or_lower` parses the JSON data into a Python dictionary. It iterates over each release in the package's version history, skipping releases that have no associated information. For each non-empty release, it checks if the `requires_python` attribute is specified and determines compatibility with Python 3.8 or lower using the `SpecifierSet` class from the `packaging` module. If `requires_python` is not specified, a default message indicating assumed compatibility with Python 3.8 or lower is added to the dictionary.

The function returns a dictionary where keys are version numbers and values describe their compatibility status. The `main` function then prints the compatible versions of the package in descending order based on version number.

**Note**: Ensure that you have the `requests` and `packaging` libraries installed in your environment as they are required for this function to work correctly.

## ClassDef ParentNodeTransformer
**ParentNodeTransformer**: The function of ParentNodeTransformer is to set the 'parent' attribute on each node in an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

**attributes**: This class does not have any explicit attributes defined.

**Code Description**: 
The `ParentNodeTransformer` class inherits from `ast.NodeTransformer`, which means it can be used to traverse and transform nodes in an AST. The primary purpose of this transformer is to set the 'parent' attribute on each node, enabling developers to track the parent-child relationships within the tree structure.

1. **generic_visit method**: This method overrides the default behavior of `ast.NodeTransformer` to visit every node in the AST. For each child node encountered during traversal, it sets the 'parent' attribute of that child to point back to its parent node.
2. **super(ParentNodeTransformer, self).generic_visit(node)**: After setting the 'parent' attribute for all children, this method calls the `generic_visit` method from the superclass (`ast.NodeTransformer`) to continue visiting the remaining nodes in the tree.

This class is typically used as part of a larger refactoring or analysis process where understanding the structure and relationships between different parts of the code is essential. By setting the 'parent' attribute, it facilitates more nuanced operations on the AST, such as verifying function definitions, class hierarchies, or other structural aspects of the code.

**Note**: Ensure that the `ast` module from Python's standard library is imported before using this transformer.
**Output Example**: The output of applying `ParentNodeTransformer().visit(tree)` to an AST would be a tree where each node has a 'parent' attribute set to its parent node, allowing for easy traversal and analysis. For example:
```
class NodeA(ast.AST):
    # ... other attributes
    parent = None  # Initially

class NodeB(ast.AST):
    # ... other attributes
    parent = NodeA()  # After applying ParentNodeTransformer

# The tree structure would be preserved, but each node would now have a 'parent' attribute pointing to its parent.
```
### FunctionDef generic_visit(self, node)
**generic_visit**: The function of generic_visit is to recursively visit each node in an abstract syntax tree (AST) and set its parent attribute.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: node - The current node being visited in the AST.

**Code Description**:
The `generic_visit` method is a part of the `ParentNodeTransformer` class, which is likely used to transform Python source code by modifying an abstract syntax tree (AST). This method performs a depth-first traversal of the AST. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Initialization and Setup**: The function starts with a loop that iterates over all child nodes of the given `node`. For each child node, it sets the `.parent` attribute to point back to the current `node`.
2. **Recursive Traversal**: After setting up the parent-child relationships for the current node's children, the method calls the superclass's `generic_visit` method on the same `node`. This ensures that all descendants of the current node are also visited and their `.parent` attributes set.
3. **Return Value**: The function returns the result of the superclass's `generic_visit` call, which typically continues the traversal up the tree.

This approach allows for a consistent way to traverse an AST while maintaining parent-child relationships, making it easier to perform transformations or analyses on the code structure.

**Note**: Ensure that the `ast` module is imported and available in your environment. Also, be aware that modifying the `.parent` attribute of nodes can affect how certain transformations are applied, so use this method carefully.

**Output Example**: The output of `generic_visit` would not produce a direct return value but rather modify the AST structure in place by setting parent attributes for each node. For example:
```python
original_ast = ast.parse("x = 5 + y")
transformer = ParentNodeTransformer()
transformed_ast = transformer.generic_visit(original_ast)
```
In this case, `generic_visit` would traverse and set `.parent` attributes for all nodes in the AST, ensuring that each node knows its parent. The resulting `transfomed_ast` would have updated `.parent` attributes reflecting the new structure after potential transformations.
***
## FunctionDef verify_full_func_at_top_level(tree, func, func_children)
**verify_full_func_at_top_level**: The function of `verify_full_func_at_top_level` is to ensure that a specified function is defined as a top-level function within a Python file.

**parameters**: 
· parameter1: `tree` - An abstract syntax tree (AST) representing the parsed content of a Python source file.
· parameter2: `func` - A string representing the name of the function to be verified.
· parameter3: `func_children` - An integer representing the expected number of children nodes (sub-statements or expressions) in the specified function.

**Code Description**: 
The function `verify_full_func_at_top_level` performs several validations on a given Python source file to ensure that a specific function is correctly defined as a top-level function. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Search**:
   - The function first searches for all instances of the specified function name (`func`) in the abstract syntax tree (`tree`). It does this by iterating over every node in `tree` using `ast.walk()` and checking if the node is an instance of `ast.FunctionDef` with a matching name.
   
2. **Assertion Check**:
   - If no instances of the specified function are found, an assertion error is raised indicating that the function was not found.

3. **Top-Level Function Verification**:
   - For each instance of the function found, it checks if the function node's parent is `ast.Module`. This ensures that the function is a top-level function and not nested inside another class or function.
   
4. **Child Node Count Comparison**:
   - The number of child nodes in the function (`num_children`) is calculated by iterating over its children using `ast.walk()`.
   - A percentage difference (`pct_diff_children`) between the actual child count and the expected child count (`func_children`) is computed.
   - If this percentage difference exceeds 10%, an assertion error is raised, indicating that the function's structure has changed significantly.

5. **Final Assertion**:
   - If any of the above checks fail, a final assertion error is raised to indicate that the specified function is not defined as a top-level function in the source file.

The function returns silently if all validations pass successfully.

This function works closely with other functions like `verify_refactor`, which parses and transforms an AST before verifying the structural integrity of specific parts of the code. Specifically, `verify_full_func_at_top_level` ensures that critical functions remain as top-level entities, maintaining their intended scope and accessibility within the module.

**Note**: Ensure that the function name (`func`) exactly matches the names in the source file to avoid false negatives or positives during verification.

**Output Example**: The function does not return a value but raises an `AssertionError` if any of the checks fail. For example, it might raise:
```
AssertionError: Old method had 5 children, new method has 7
``` 
or
```
AssertionError: Function my_function not found
```
## FunctionDef verify_old_class_children(tree, old_class, old_class_children)
**verify_old_class_children**: The function of verify_old_class_children is to ensure that the number of child class definitions under an old class has not changed significantly during refactoring.

**parameters**:
· tree: An abstract syntax tree (AST) representing the Python source code file.
· old_class: A string representing the name of the old class being verified.
· old_class_children: An integer indicating the expected number of direct child classes under the old class.

**Code Description**: The function verify_old_class_children performs a verification step during the refactoring process to ensure that the refactored code does not introduce significant changes in the structure of the class hierarchy. Specifically, it traverses the abstract syntax tree (AST) generated from the Python source code file passed as `tree`. It searches for the old class specified by `old_class` and checks if its number of direct child classes has changed significantly compared to what was expected (`old_class_children`). 

1. **Node Search**: The function uses a generator expression within `next()` to find the first `ast.ClassDef` node in the AST that matches the name `old_class`. If such a node is found, it assigns this node to the variable `node`; otherwise, it sets `node` to `None`.
2. **Assertion Check**: The function asserts that the old class was indeed found by checking if `node` is not `None`. If `node` is `None`, an assertion error is raised with a message indicating that the old class could not be located.
3. **Child Count Calculation**: It then calculates the total number of child nodes under the identified old class node using `ast.walk(node)` and counting each node with a generator expression.
4. **Percentage Difference Calculation**: The function computes the percentage difference between the actual number of children (`num_children`) and the expected number of children (`old_class_children`). If this percentage difference exceeds 10%, an assertion error is raised, indicating that the refactoring has significantly altered the class hierarchy.

This function plays a crucial role in ensuring that during code refactoring, the structure of class hierarchies remains consistent to avoid unintended side effects or breaking changes. It is called by another function `verify_refactor`, which handles the broader context of verifying the entire refactor process, including function definitions and class structures.

**Note**: Ensure that the AST generated from the Python source file is up-to-date before calling this function. Any modifications to the code structure should be reflected in the AST for accurate verification results.

## ClassDef SelfUsageChecker
**SelfUsageChecker**: The function of SelfUsageChecker is to detect methods within classes that do not use 'self' or 'super' as parameters or references.

**attributes**: 
· `non_self_methods`: A list storing information about methods that do not use 'self' or 'super'.
· `parent_class_name`: The name of the current class being visited.
· `num_class_children`: The number of nodes in the current class definition.

**Code Description**: SelfUsageChecker is a custom NodeVisitor subclass from the ast module, designed to traverse and analyze Python Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). It primarily focuses on identifying methods within classes that do not use 'self' or 'super', which can indicate potential issues such as misuse of instance variables or inappropriate class structure. Here’s how it works:

1. **Initialization**: The `__init__` method initializes the checker with an empty list to store non-self-using methods and sets initial values for tracking the current class name and number of nodes.

2. **Visiting Function Definitions (`visit_FunctionDef`)**: This method is called whenever a function definition node (FunctionDef) is encountered during traversal. It checks if the first argument of the function is 'self'. If so, it then verifies whether 'self' or 'super' are used within the body of the function. If neither are found, it calculates the number of nodes in the function and appends detailed information about this method to `non_self_methods`.

3. **Visiting Class Definitions (`visit_ClassDef`)**: This method is invoked when a class definition node (ClassDef) is encountered. It updates the checker with the current class name and counts the total number of nodes within the class, preparing for further method checks.

4. **Generic Visit**: The `generic_visit` method ensures that all child nodes are also visited, ensuring comprehensive analysis of the AST.

**Note**: SelfUsageChecker should be used in conjunction with other tools or scripts that process Python files to identify and potentially refactor methods that do not use 'self' or 'super', which can help maintain cleaner and more consistent code. The `find_non_self_methods` function provided in the project demonstrates how to integrate this checker into a broader analysis pipeline, processing multiple Python files and collecting information on non-self-using methods across them.
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize instance attributes when an instance of SelfUsageChecker is created.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` method initializes several instance variables for the `SelfUsageChecker` class. Specifically, it sets up a list `non_self_methods` to store non-self-method references, assigns `parent_class_name` to None (indicating that the parent class name is not yet known), and initializes `num_class_children` to 0 (representing the number of child classes).

1. **self.non_self_methods = []**: This line creates an empty list to hold method names or references that are not associated with self, which could be methods from other classes used within the class under analysis.
2. **self.parent_class_name = None**: Here, a default value `None` is assigned to `parent_class_name`, indicating that at this point in time, no parent class name has been determined for the instance of SelfUsageChecker.
3. **self.num_class_children = 0**: This line initializes a counter `num_class_children` to zero, which will be used later to keep track of how many child classes are associated with the current class.

These initializations prepare the object for further operations such as analyzing method usage and determining class hierarchy relationships within the codebase.
**Note**: Ensure that when an instance of SelfUsageChecker is created, all these attributes are properly set up before any methods dependent on them are called. This helps in maintaining consistency and avoiding potential runtime errors due to uninitialized variables.
***
### FunctionDef visit_FunctionDef(self, node)
**visit_FunctionDef**: The function of visit_FunctionDef is to check if a method uses 'self' or 'super', and record methods that do not use 'self' or 'super'.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: node (ast.FunctionDef) - This parameter represents the function definition node in the abstract syntax tree (AST).

**Code Description**: 
This function is part of a class designed to analyze Python code, specifically focusing on method definitions. It checks if the first argument of a function definition is 'self' and whether this 'self' or 'super' are used within the body of the function.

1. **Check for 'self' as First Argument**: The function starts by checking if the first argument of the function definition (`node.args.args[0].arg`) is named 'self'. If not, it skips further checks.
2. **Check Usage of 'self' and 'super'**: 
   - It then walks through all statements in the body of the function to see if any variable or name within these statements is a reference to 'self'.
   - Similarly, it also checks for references to 'super'.
3. **Determine If Method Uses Neither 'self' nor 'super'**:
   - If neither 'self' nor 'super' are used in the method body, it calculates the number of child nodes (sub-statements) within the function.
   - It then appends a tuple containing information about the class and method names, along with their respective counts of children to `non_self_methods`.

4. **Generic Visit**: Finally, the function calls `self.generic_visit(node)` which is likely a method inherited from a base visitor class that visits other nodes in the AST.

**Note**: This function assumes that the input node is a valid function definition (`ast.FunctionDef`). Ensure that the provided node is of this type to avoid unexpected behavior. Additionally, it relies on the `ast` module for parsing and traversing the abstract syntax tree.
***
### FunctionDef visit_ClassDef(self, node)
**visit_ClassDef**: The function of visit_ClassDef is to process a class definition node during an abstract syntax tree (AST) traversal.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: node - This parameter represents the current class definition node being processed during the AST walk.

**Code Description**: 
The `visit_ClassDef` method is part of a custom visitor class designed for traversing and inspecting nodes in an abstract syntax tree. Here’s a detailed analysis:

- **Line 1: self.parent_class_name = node.name**
  - This line assigns the name of the current class definition node to the instance variable `parent_class_name`. The purpose is to store the name of the class for further processing or reference.

- **Line 2: self.num_class_children = sum(1 for _ in ast.walk(node))**
  - This line calculates the total number of child nodes within the current class definition by using a generator expression with `ast.walk(node)`. The `sum` function iterates over all sub-nodes, counting them. This helps in understanding the complexity or structure of the class.

- **Line 3: self.generic_visit(node)**
  - This line calls the `generic_visit` method on the current instance (`self`). The `generic_visit` method is a standard method used by visitor classes to visit all child nodes that are not specifically handled by other methods. It ensures that every node in the AST is visited, providing a comprehensive traversal.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `ast` module from Python's standard library is imported at the beginning of the file.
- The `node` parameter should be correctly passed to this method during an AST walk, typically initiated by calling it on an instance of the visitor class with the root node of the AST.
***
## FunctionDef find_python_files(path)
**find_python_files**: The function of find_python_files is to locate all Python files within a specified directory or return the file if it's a single Python file.
**Parameters**:
· path: A string representing the directory path or filename to search for Python files.

**Code Description**: 
The `find_python_files` function serves as a utility to identify and list all Python (.py) files either in a given directory or within a specified path. Here's a detailed analysis of its operation:

1. **File Check**: The function first checks if the provided `path` is a file using `os.path.isfile(path)` and verifies that it ends with ".py" using `path.endswith(".py")`. If both conditions are met, it returns a list containing just this single Python file.
2. **Directory Traversal**: If `path` is a directory (checked via `os.path.isdir(path)`), the function proceeds to traverse all files within this directory and its subdirectories recursively using `os.walk()`.
3. **File Filtering**: During traversal, it filters out only those files that end with ".py" by checking each file name with `file.endswith(".py")`.
4. **Full Path Construction**: For every Python file found, the function constructs a full path using `os.path.join(root, file)`, where `root` is the current directory in the traversal and `file` is the filename.
5. **Result Compilation**: All matching files are collected into a list called `py_files`.
6. **Return Value**: Finally, the function returns this list of Python files.

The function plays a crucial role in preparing the necessary input for other functions such as `find_non_self_methods`, which requires a list of all relevant Python files to process further.

**Note**: The function assumes that the provided path is valid and accessible. It does not handle cases where the directory or file might be inaccessible due to permissions issues or non-existent paths.

**Output Example**: If you call `find_python_files("/path/to/directory")`, it might return something like:
```
['/path/to/directory/file1.py', '/path/to/directory/subdir/file2.py']
```
## FunctionDef find_non_self_methods(path)
**find_non_self_methods**: The function of find_non_self_methods is to identify methods within Python files that do not use 'self' or 'super' as parameters or references.

**Parameters**:
· path: A string representing the directory path or filename containing Python files to be processed.

**Code Description**:
The `find_non_self_methods` function performs a comprehensive search for methods in Python files, specifically identifying those that do not utilize the 'self' parameter. This is achieved through several steps:

1. **Initialization**: The function starts by calling `find_python_files(path)` to obtain a list of all Python files within the specified directory or as individual files.
2. **File Processing**: For each file in the list, the function processes its content line-by-line using a for loop.
3. **Method Detection and Analysis**:
   - The function scans lines containing method definitions (indicated by `def` followed by a space).
   - It then inspects these methods to determine if they use the 'self' parameter or reference it in any way.
4. **Collection of Results**: For each file, the function collects information about methods that do not utilize 'self'. This includes method names and their locations within the codebase.

The function is called by `main(paths)`, which iterates over a list of paths and processes each one using `find_non_self_methods`. After processing, it sorts the results based on some criteria (though this step is commented out in the provided snippet).

**Note**: The function assumes that all input files are valid Python scripts. It does not handle cases where directories or files might be inaccessible due to permissions issues or non-existent paths.

**Output Example**: If you call `find_non_self_methods("/path/to/directory")`, it might return a list of tuples, each representing a method without the 'self' parameter:
```
[('/path/to/directory/file1.py', 'def my_method():'), 
 ('/path/to/directory/subdir/file2.py', 'def another_method()')]
```
## FunctionDef process(entry)
**process**: The function of process is to identify and refactor methods within classes based on specific criteria.
**parameters**: 
· entry: This parameter contains information about the method being processed, including file name (fname), class name (class_name), method name (method_name), number of children in the class (class_children), and number of children in the method (method_children).

**Code Description**: The process function evaluates whether a method within a class should be refactored based on certain conditions. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Entry Parsing**: The function first unpacks the entry parameter, which contains information about the file name, class name, method name, and the number of children in both the class and method.
2. **Condition Checks**:
   - If the number of children in the method (method_children) is greater than half the number of children in the class (class_children), the function returns without further processing.
   - If the number of children in the method is less than 250, the function also returns early without proceeding with further steps.
3. **File Name Validation**: The function checks if the file name contains "test" in its stem (i.e., the base name before any extension). If it does, the function skips processing this entry.
4. **Output Logging**: If none of the above conditions are met, the function logs details about the method and class using a print statement.
5. **Directory Creation**: The function creates temporary directories to store refactored code and test files. It uses the stem of the file name along with the class and method names to create unique directory paths.
6. **Copying Original Code**: The original source file is copied into the newly created directory for further processing or review.
7. **Generating Documentation**: A markdown file named "instructions.md" is generated in the .docs subdirectory, providing instructions on how to refactor the method into a standalone function. This includes renaming the method and updating any calls within the class that reference this method.
8. **Creating Test File**: A test file named `*_test.py` is created with a basic test case using the unittest framework. The test case verifies if the refactored code meets certain criteria by calling the verify_refactor function.

The process function ensures that only methods meeting specific criteria are selected for refactoring, and it provides clear instructions and test cases to facilitate this transformation.

**Note**: Ensure that the temporary directories and files created do not conflict with existing paths or files. The function handles directory creation using `exist_ok=True`, which prevents errors if the directories already exist. However, be cautious of potential issues if multiple processes are running concurrently.

**Output Example**: 
```
/tmp/somefile.py SomeClass some_method 420 350
Creating /tmp.benchmarks/refactor-benchmark-spyder/somefile_SomeClass_some_method
Copying /tmp/somefile.py to /tmp.benchmarks/refactor-benchmark-spyder/somefile_SomeClass_some_method/somefile.py

## FunctionDef get_model_color(model)
**get_model_color**: The function of get_model_color is to determine the color based on the model name.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: model (str) - The name of the model for which the color needs to be determined.

**Code Description**: 
The `get_model_color` function assigns a specific color to a given model name. It uses a series of conditional checks to determine the appropriate color based on the model's name and returns it. If no matching condition is found, it defaults to "lightblue".

1. The function first sets a default color value as "lightblue".
2. It then checks if the model name is exactly "gpt-4o-mini". If so, it returns "lightblue" (the same as the default).
3. Next, it looks for models that contain the substring "-4o". If found, it assigns the color "purple".
4. Then, it checks if the model name contains "gpt-4", returning "red" in this case.
5. Finally, it checks if the model name contains "gpt-3.5", and returns "green" if true.
6. If none of the above conditions are met, it returns the default color "lightblue".

The function is called by `plot_over_time` to assign colors to different models in a plot based on their names. This helps visually differentiate models with similar functionalities or performance metrics.

**Note**: Ensure that the model name passed to this function is correctly formatted as expected by the conditions within the function.

**Output Example**: 
If the input model name is "gpt-4o-mini", the output will be "lightblue". If it is "gpt-3.5-turbo", the output will be "green". For any other model name, such as "davinci-002", the function will return "lightblue" by default.
## FunctionDef plot_over_time(yaml_file)
**plot_over_time**: The function of plot_over_time is to visualize the pass rates over time for different models based on data from a YAML file.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: yaml_file (str) - Path to the YAML file containing the model release dates, pass rates, and other relevant information.

**Code Description**: 
The `plot_over_time` function processes data from a YAML file to generate a line plot showing how the pass rates of different models have changed over time. Here is a detailed breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Data Loading and Initial Debugging Output**:
    - The function starts by opening and reading the YAML file specified by `yaml_file`.
    - It then loads the data into memory using `yaml.safe_load()`, which converts the YAML content into a Python dictionary.
    - A debug message is printed to show the raw data from the YAML file.

2. **Data Processing**:
    - The function iterates through the loaded data, extracting model names, release dates, and pass rates.
    - It initializes lists (`dates`, `pass_rates`, and `model_names`) to store these extracted values.
    - For each entry in the data, it appends the relevant information to these lists.

3. **Color Assignment**:
    - The function calls `get_model_color` for each model name to determine its color based on predefined conditions.
    - These colors are stored in a list (`colors`) and used later for plotting.

4. **Plotting**:
    - It uses matplotlib (not shown in the provided code) to create a line plot.
    - The x-axis represents time, with dates from `dates`.
    - The y-axis shows the pass rates from `pass_rates`.
    - Different models are plotted using different colors based on the `colors` list.

5. **Debugging and Output**:
    - Finally, it prints out the model names to verify that they have been correctly processed.
    - A debug message is printed to show the model names after processing.

The function relies on `get_model_color` to assign appropriate colors to different models, which helps in visually distinguishing them in the plot. This makes it easier to identify trends and performance differences among various models over time.

**Note**: Ensure that the YAML file is correctly formatted and contains all necessary information (model names, release dates, pass rates). Any missing or incorrectly formatted data may result in errors during processing.

**Output Example**: The function does not return a value but generates a line plot showing the pass rates of different models over time. Each model is represented by a line with a specific color determined by its name. For instance, "gpt-4o-mini" might be plotted in light blue, while "gpt-3.5-turbo" would appear in green.

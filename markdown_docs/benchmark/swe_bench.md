## FunctionDef plot_swe_bench(data_file, is_lite)
**plot_swe_bench**: The function of plot_swe_bench is to generate bar charts based on data from a specified file, differentiating between standard and lite versions.
**Parameters**:
· parameter1: `data_file` - A string representing the path to the input data file containing model pass rates.
· parameter2: `is_lite` - A boolean indicating whether to plot the "SWE Bench Lite" version or the full version.

**Code Description**: The function `plot_swe_bench` processes a text file containing performance metrics of various machine learning models and generates bar charts visualizing these metrics. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **File Reading and Data Parsing**:
   - The function opens the specified `data_file` in read mode.
   - Each line in the file is processed to extract model names, pass rates, and instance numbers (if applicable).
   - Models are stripped of unnecessary characters like pipes (`|`), and pass rates are converted into floating-point numbers.

2. **Bar Chart Configuration**:
   - The function sets up the plot's appearance by configuring parameters such as font style, color, and grid visibility.
   - Depending on the `is_lite` parameter, different colors are assigned to models containing "Aider" in their names for distinction between standard and lite versions.

3. **Bar Plotting**:
   - For each model, a bar is created with its pass rate as height.
   - The transparency (`alpha`) of the bars is adjusted based on whether they contain "Aider".
   - Hatching patterns are applied to some models based on specific conditions (currently commented out).

4. **Text Annotations**:
   - Labels for each model's pass rate are added at the top of their respective bars.
   - Additional text indicating instance numbers associated with certain models is placed below these labels.

5. **Plot Customization and Saving**:
   - The x-axis label, y-axis label, and title are set according to the version being plotted (Lite or Standard).
   - The plot is saved as both a JPEG and an SVG file using the input data file's name with appropriate suffixes.
   - The `imgcat` function is called to display the generated plot directly in the terminal.

6. **Error Handling**:
   - The function uses the `Path` class from the `pathlib` module for handling file paths, ensuring compatibility and robustness.

**Note**: Ensure that the input data file has a specific format where each line contains pass rate followed by model name (and optionally instance number). Also, verify that the `imgcat` function is available in your environment as it may not be part of standard Python libraries.

## ClassDef TestCleanupTestOutput
**TestCleanupTestOutput**: The function of TestCleanupTestOutput is to verify the functionality of a cleanup_test_output function that processes test output strings.

**Code Description**: 
The class `TestCleanupTestOutput` inherits from `unittest.TestCase`, which indicates its purpose is to facilitate unit testing for a specific functionality. It contains two methods: `test_cleanup_test_output` and `test_cleanup_test_output_lines`.

- **Method: test_cleanup_test_output**
  - This method tests the cleanup of test output strings that include timing information.
  - **Parameter**: No explicit parameters are passed directly into this method; it uses predefined string variables for testing purposes.
  - The first test case checks if a string containing both test execution details and timing information is correctly cleaned up to only include the success message "OK".
  - The second test case ensures that a simple "OK" string, which does not contain any timing or failure information, remains unchanged after cleanup.

- **Method: test_cleanup_test_output_lines**
  - This method tests the cleanup of more complex strings containing detailed failure output.
  - It uses a multiline string variable `output` as input and compares it with an expected cleaned-up version stored in `expected`.
  - The purpose is to verify that the cleanup function correctly handles failure messages, including traceback details and assertion errors.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the test cases cover various scenarios of test output strings, especially those containing detailed failures.
- Pay attention to the exact formatting and content of the expected output to ensure accurate testing.
### FunctionDef test_cleanup_test_output(self)
**test_cleanup_test_output**: The function of test_cleanup_test_output is to verify that the `cleanup_test_output` method correctly processes and cleans up the output string from test execution results.

**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
- **self**: A reference to the instance of the class, which provides access to the instance variables defined in the same class. It is implicitly passed by Python when a method is called on an object.

**Code Description**: The function `test_cleanup_test_test_output` contains two test cases designed to validate the functionality of another method named `cleanup_test_output`. This method presumably takes a string as input and returns it with certain elements removed or modified, such as timing information. 

1. **Test Case 1: With Timing Info**
   - Input:
     ```python
     output = "Ran 5 tests in 0.003s\nOK"
     expected = "\nOK"
     ```
   - The function compares the result of `cleanup_test_output(output)` with the `expected` string, which is `\nOK`. This test checks if the timing information ("Ran 5 tests in 0.003s") is successfully removed from the output.

2. **Test Case 2: Without Timing Info**
   - Input:
     ```python
     output = "OK"
     expected = "OK"
     ```
   - The function compares `cleanup_test_output(output)` with the `expected` string, which remains as `"OK"`. This test ensures that if no timing information is present in the input, the method returns the same string without any modifications.

**Note**: Ensure that the `cleanup_test_output` method is correctly implemented to handle both cases where timing info is present and absent. Also, verify that all possible edge cases are covered by additional tests outside this function.

### FunctionDef test_cleanup_test_output_lines(self)
**test_cleanup_test_output_lines**: The function of `test_cleanup_test_output_lines` is to verify that the output from a test case is correctly cleaned up.

**Parameters**:
Â· self: A reference to the current instance of the class, allowing access to methods and attributes defined within the same class.

**Code Description**: 
The function `test_cleanup_test_output_lines` tests whether the cleanup process for a specific test output is performed correctly. It does this by comparing the actual cleaned-up output with an expected result using the `self.assertEqual()` method. 

1. **Step 1: Define the Output**
   ```python
   output = """F
======================================================================
FAIL: test_cleanup_test_output (test_benchmark.TestCleanupTestOutput.test_cleanup_test_output)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/gauthier/Projects/aider/benchmark/test_benchmark.py", line 14, in test_cleanup_test_output
    self.assertEqual(cleanup_test_output(output), expected)
AssertionError: 'OK' != 'OKx'
- OK
+ OKx
?   +
"""
   ```
   This step defines the raw output generated by a failing test case. The output includes detailed information about the failure, such as the failure message and traceback.

2. **Step 2: Define the Expected Output**
   ```python
   expected = """F
====
FAIL: test_cleanup_test_output (test_benchmark.TestCleanupTestOutput.test_cleanup_test_output)
----
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/gauthier/Projects/aider/benchmark/test_benchmark.py", line 14, in test_cleanup_test_output
    self.assertEqual(cleanup_test_output(output), expected)
AssertionError: 'OK' != 'OKx'
- OK
+ OKx
?   +
"""
   ```
   The `expected` variable holds the desired output after the cleanup process. This includes the cleaned-up version of the failure message and traceback.

3. **Step 3: Clean Up the Output and Compare**
   ```python
   self.assertEqual(cleanup_test_output(output), expected)
   ```
   Here, the function calls `cleanup_test_output()` on the raw `output`, expecting it to produce a result that matches the `expected` output. The `self.assertEqual()` method is used to assert this equality.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the path in the traceback file name (`/Users/gauthier/Projects/aider/benchmark/test_benchmark.py`) remains consistent with your project structure.
- Verify that the cleanup logic implemented in `cleanup_test_output()` correctly processes and formats the test output as expected. Any discrepancies between the actual and expected outputs will result in a failed assertion, indicating an issue with the cleanup process.

## FunctionDef plot_timing(df)
**plot_timing**: The function of plot_timing is to create a bar chart showing the average duration of each (model, edit_format) combination.
**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· df: A pandas DataFrame containing the data with columns "model", "edit_format", and "avg_duration".

**Code Description**: 
The `plot_timing` function generates a detailed bar chart to visualize the average response time for different models and edit formats in an automated code editing process. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the function:

1. **Customize Plot Settings**: The function first customizes the plot settings by setting the grid lines on the y-axis, adjusting font styles, and defining colors and hatches for bars.

2. **Create Subplot and Grid**: A figure and axis are created using `plt.subplots`, with a specified size of 6x4 inches to ensure the chart is appropriately sized.

3. **Group Data**: The data frame (`df`) is grouped by "model" and "edit_format", calculating the mean average duration for each combination, resulting in a multi-level DataFrame structure where rows are models and columns are edit formats.

4. **Bar Chart Setup**: 
   - `pos` is defined to hold positions of bars corresponding to models.
   - `width` is calculated to determine the width of each bar relative to the number of format types.
   - The function iterates over each "edit_format", setting specific properties for each bar, such as color and hatch pattern.

5. **Bar Plotting**: For each edit format, a bar plot is created using `ax.bar`, with custom labels showing the average duration in seconds.

6. **X-axis Configuration**: Positions of x-ticks are set to be centered between model bars, and corresponding labels (model names) are placed at these positions.

7. **Y-axis Labeling and Title**: The y-axis label is set to indicate the unit of measurement for the data, and a title is added to describe the chart.

8. **Legend Placement**: A legend is created with "Edit Format" as its title, positioned in the upper left corner of the plot.

9. **Y-axis Limit Adjustment**: The maximum value on the y-axis is adjusted by 10% to ensure all data points are visible and appropriately scaled.

10. **Save and Display Chart**: Finally, the chart is saved as an SVG file named "tmp_timing.svg" using `plt.savefig`, and displayed immediately with `imgcat`.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the input DataFrame (`df`) has the required columns: "model", "edit_format", and "avg_duration".
- The function relies on external libraries such as matplotlib and pandas, so these must be installed in your environment.
- Adjustments might be needed if the data structure or column names differ from expectations.
## FunctionDef plot_outcomes(df, repeats, repeat_hi, repeat_lo, repeat_avg)
**plot_outcomes**: The function of `plot_outcomes` is to create a bar chart that visualizes the pass rates of different models and edit formats based on provided data.
**parameters**:
- df: A pandas DataFrame containing the results of coding exercises, with columns such as "model", "edit_format", and "pass_rate_2".
- repeats: An integer indicating the number of repeated trials for a specific model and edit format.
- repeat_hi: The upper bound value of the error bar representing the highest pass rate observed in repeated trials.
- repeat_lo: The lower bound value of the error bar representing the lowest pass rate observed in repeated trials.
- repeat_avg: The average pass rate from repeated trials.

**Code Description**: 
The function `plot_outcomes` is designed to generate a detailed bar chart that showcases the performance of different models and edit formats based on the provided data. It first groups the DataFrame by "model" and "edit_format", calculating the mean pass rates for two specific columns: "pass_rate_2" and optionally "pass_rate_1". The function then customizes the appearance of the plot, setting parameters like grid lines and font styles.

The main part of the code involves creating a bar chart with multiple bars grouped by models and edit formats. Each format is represented by a different color and hatch pattern to distinguish between "diff" and "func" types. The `zorder` parameter is used to control the stacking order, ensuring that error bars are drawn on top of the bars.

For each group, the function creates a bar plot with custom styling options such as edge colors and labels. If the zorder is greater than 1, additional edge properties like linewidth and label are applied. The `ax.bar_label` method is used to add text labels to the bars for better readability.

If there are repeated trials (indicated by non-zero values in `repeats`), an error bar is added to highlight the variability of pass rates across different trials using `repeat_hi` and `repeat_lo`.

The function further customizes the x-axis tick labels, positioning them at appropriate intervals. It also adds annotations to provide additional context about the first and second attempts based on natural language instructions and unit test error output.

Finally, the chart is annotated with a title, y-axis label, and legend. The y-axis limits are set to ensure that the pass rates are displayed correctly. The plot is saved as an SVG file using `plt.savefig`, and then displayed using `imgcat`.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that all required libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and numpy are installed before running this function.
- The DataFrame `df` must have specific columns like "model", "edit_format", and "pass_rate_2" for the bar chart to be generated correctly.
- Adjust the `plt.rcParams` settings according to your preference or requirements.
## FunctionDef plot_outcomes_claude(df)
**plot_outcomes_claude**: The function of plot_outcomes_claude is to visualize the pass rates of different models based on their outcomes.
**parameters**: 
· df: A pandas DataFrame containing model names and corresponding pass rates.

**Code Description**: 
1. **Data Inspection and Preparation**: The function starts by printing the input DataFrame `df` to inspect its contents. It then replaces a specific model label "gpt-4-0314" with "gpt-4-0613". This step ensures consistency in the data labels.
2. **Bar Chart Setup**: The code sets up the matplotlib environment and creates a figure and axis object for plotting. The grid is enabled on the y-axis to provide better readability.
3. **Plotting Multiple Attempts**: The function iterates over two attempts (pass_rate_2 and pass_rate_1) to plot bar charts side by side. For each attempt, it calculates positions (`pos`), width of bars (`width`), and sets up the appearance of the bars including color and edge properties.
4. **Bar Plot Customization**: The bars are customized with different colors and hatch patterns based on their position in the sequence. Specific annotations for the first and second attempts are added to highlight key information about each attempt.
5. **X-Axis Labeling**: Model names from the DataFrame are mapped to a more readable format using `model_map`, and these labels are set as tick labels on the x-axis with proper rotation for better visibility.
6. **Annotations and Titles**: The function adds annotations to explain different aspects of the data visually, such as first and second attempts. It also sets up the y-label, title, and limits for the plot.
7. **Saving and Displaying Plot**: Finally, the figure is saved as an SVG file named "tmp.svg" using `plt.savefig`, and the image is displayed directly if possible via `imgcat`.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that necessary libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, numpy, and imgcat are installed in your environment.
- The function relies on specific DataFrame columns ("model", "pass_rate_2", "pass_rate_1") which must be present for the code to execute correctly. Any missing or incorrect column names will lead to errors.
- The visual aesthetics of the plot (such as hatch patterns and colors) are hardcoded, so modifications might require direct changes in the code.
## FunctionDef plot_refactoring(df)
**plot_refactoring**: The function of `plot_refactoring` is to create a bar chart comparing the pass rates of different models and edit formats in a refactoring benchmark.
**parameters**: 
· df: A pandas DataFrame containing the results of the benchmark, with columns for "model", "edit_format", and "pass_rate_1".

**Code Description**: The `plot_refactoring` function is designed to visualize the performance data from a refactoring benchmark. It takes a DataFrame as input, which contains information about different models and their pass rates under various edit formats.

The function first groups the DataFrame by model and edit format, calculating the mean pass rate for each group. This step prepares the data for visualization. The `plt.rcParams` settings are applied to customize the appearance of the plot, such as setting the hatch pattern and line width.

A `subplots` object is created with a specified figure size. A grid is added to the y-axis to improve readability. The function iterates over the grouped data, creating bar charts for each edit format. Each model's performance is represented by a different color or hatch pattern, making it easy to distinguish between them.

The positions of the models on the x-axis are calculated using an array and width values that determine the spacing between bars. For each edit format, the function creates a set of bars representing the pass rates for each model. Labels are added directly above the bars to show the exact pass rate percentages.

The x-axis is labeled with the names of the models, which are formatted to improve readability. The y-axis label and title of the plot are set accordingly. Finally, the chart is saved as an SVG file using `plt.savefig` and displayed using `imgcat`.

This function is called by `benchmark/benchmark.py/show_stats`, where it processes the DataFrame of benchmark results and generates a visual representation to help analyze model performance under different edit formats.

**Note**: Ensure that the input DataFrame has the correct columns ("model", "edit_format", and "pass_rate_1"). The function assumes that these columns are present in the provided DataFrame. Additionally, the `imgcat` library must be installed for the plot to display correctly.
